WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES
-----------------------

- Displays monthly energy cost data (actuals + forecasts) for FY2026 (July 2025 -- June 2026)
- Compares actual spending to forecasts with budget status tracking
- Breaks down costs by electric vs gas, with supplier detail (Kintec, Avista, Inland Power)
- Shows trends across 9 interactive tabs: Dashboard, Monthly Detail, Gas Analysis, Energy Use, Year-over-Year, Cumulative Summary, Price vs Volume, HDD/Weather, Data Sources
- Includes a print-optimized executive summary for 8.5x11 output


HOW IT WORKS
------------

1. Energy billing data is entered into the Excel workbook (4 sheets)
2. Click "Export data.json" button in Excel (runs VBA macro)
3. Macro reads data, cross-checks against Consolidated Data, writes data.json
4. Upload data.json to this GitHub repo (web upload or git push)
5. GitHub Pages serves the updated dashboard automatically
