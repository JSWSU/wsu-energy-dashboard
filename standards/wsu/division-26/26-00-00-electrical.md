PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 DESIGN STANDARDS
A. All electrical designs shall comply with the latest editions of the National Electrical Code (NFPA 70) and the Laws, Rules and Regulations for Installing Electric Wires and Equipment (applicable sections of WAC and RCW).
B. In addition to designing the electrical system(s), the Electrical Consultant shall prepare all load calculations, fault current calculations and all other data required for the submittal of the electrical drawings and specifications to the Department of Labor and Industries. The WSU Project Manager will provide to the Consultant (1) the maximum demand for the previous twelve months on the medium voltage feeder and substation main bus involved, and (2) a copy of the One Line Diagram of the medium voltage feeder involved back to the utility point of service. Consultant is required to evaluate all WSU provided information and field verify. Consultant is required to coordinate with the local utility for available fault duty at the utility point of service. When 30-day demand measurements are needed per NEC, Consultant shall be responsible for completing these measurements.
1.02 DRAWING REQUIREMENTS
A. Drawings shall be clear and concise; avoid duplication of information on the drawings. Lettering shall be at least large enough so that it is legible when reduced to half size. Words shall be spelled out complete when possible. All verbiage on plans shall not overlap any other drawing elements. All abbreviations shall be identified on the abbreviation index of the drawings.
B. The following information should be shown on the working drawings:
1. Site Plan and Legend.
2. Lighting Plan, Fixture Schedule and Lighting Control.
3. Power Plan and Panel board Schedules.
4. Equipment Schedule showing all electrically connected equipment identifying power and control requirements and responsibility scope. All information shown on equipment schedule shall coordinate with all disciplines.
5. One Line Power Distribution Diagrams (normal and emergency).
6. Riser diagrams and control diagrams for all Grounding, Fire Alarm, Data, A/V, Security, Lighting Control, and other systems.
7. Wiring and Interconnection Diagrams to all associated disciplines involved.
