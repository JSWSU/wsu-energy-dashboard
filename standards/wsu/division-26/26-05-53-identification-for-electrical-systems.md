PART 1 - PRODUCTS
1.01 BRANCH CIRCUIT PANEL BOARD DIRECTORIES:
A. Panel Schedule shall be formatted in the latest version of Microsoft Excel, an electronic copy shall be incorporated in the O&M and format shall be approved by Washington State University (WSU) Construction Manager.
B. Number each single pole space: odd numbered circuits on left side, even on right side (i.e., 1,3,5,7,9, etc., on the left side, 2,4,6,8,10, etc. on the right). For panels with a single column of breakers, number each single pole space sequentially. Securely mount on inside face of panelboard door. Typewritten panel schedules only; handwritten schedules will not be accepted.
C. Confirm room numbers with WSU Construction Manager prior to noting on schedules.
D. Indicate the name of the source for the panel on either the panel schedule or the panelboard.
E. Spare circuit breakers and space positions shall be noted with their own separate space.
F. Panel schedules and circuit numbers on Project Record drawings shall agree.
1.02 NAMEPLATES
A. Materials
1. Provide nameplates constructed of 1/16" thick plastic laminated material. Engrave through colored surface material to contrasting colored sub-layer
2. Stainless steel wall plates are preferred on the WSU campus. Stainless steel plates shall be engraved with epoxy filled paint and all emergency circuits shall have "EMERGENCY POWER" engraved on the plate above the voltage, circuit# and panel ID. Use red for emergency circuits and black for normal circuits. All labeling shall have Voltage, Circuit#, Panel ID. Minimum lettering size shall be 3/16".
3. When approved by the WSU Project Manager, nylon wall plates may be substituted for stainless steel. Nylon wall plates shall be labeled with Dymo-Tape or equal. All labeling shall have Voltage, Circuit#, Panel ID. Minimum lettering size shall be 3/16".
B. Provide nameplates for the following:
