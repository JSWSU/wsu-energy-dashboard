PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 GENERAL CRITERIA
A. General Design Criteria

5. Provide liquid flow measuring/control devices for air handling coils, branch lines serving fan coil units, heat exchangers, selected pumped systems, etc., that will aid in future balancing and troubleshooting.
6. Install each run with the minimum necessary joints and couplings, but with adequate and accessible unions for disassembly, maintenance, or replacement of valves and equipment.
7. Provide manual air vents at high points of all pumped piping systems.
8. All heating and air conditioning designed and installed on the WSU campus shall be installed with individual room control.
i. If this is not achievable within the project parameters, design team shall discuss realistic and acceptable alternatives with the WSU PM/CM, Engineering Services, and project clients.

D. Air Distribution System
1. Single blade quadrant volume dampers shall not be used immediately behind diffusers or grilles because of tendency to throw air to one side and prevent uniform air flow across outlet face.
2. Turning vanes shall be installed perpendicular to the entering air and leaving air to minimize air flow turbulence.
3. Manual volume dampers shall be provided in duct drops or take-offs to diffuser and registers to limit total air to the face damper of the registers or neck damper of the diffuser. Face and neck dampers are not acceptable; these produce objectionable noise levels.
4. Outside air louvers can create objectionable air noise on large systems. Use widely spaced louver blades with edges rounded (or double folded) to prevent high pitch air noises. Use intake screens with openings of at least one-half inch squares to prevent clogging and still keep large objects out. In addition, intake screens shall be installed to minimize ice build-up.
i. Preferred Product: 1) Industrial Netting OB2650 polypro with 1" mesh (12 lb per 1000 square feet) 2) or equal
5. Install manual dampers downstream of hot and cold zone dampers on each zone of a double duct system.
6. Use double thickness or extended edge turning vanes in all elbows, return as well as supply.
7. Install manual balancing dampers at each branch duct inlet on vertical duct chases or main return ducts.
8. Provide ceiling-mounted extension hardware wherever possible.
9. Install adequate size access doors within working distance of volume dampers, fire dampers, pressure reducing valves, reheat coils, mixing boxes, constant volume regulators, etc., to permit required adjustments.
10. Avoid placing a return air opening directly in or adjacent to the return air plenum. Even sound lining of the duct opening and plenum will not reduce transmitted noise to acceptable levels.
11. Motorized opposed blade or parallel blade volume dampers used as mixed air damper or variable volume dampers shall be provided with felt

or foam rubber on damper blade for positive shutoff when blades are in closed position. Damper actuator shall not be located in the outside air stream or outside the building.
12. All duct joints, seams, casing and plenum connections shall be sealed to assure a maximum duct leakage of 3 percent or less on systems less than 2" wg, 1 percent on 2" and above. Duct tape not allowed. Consult with WSU Engineering Services on duct seal class requirements, sealant types, and methods of sealing.
13. Duct design for pressure classes above 2" should utilize spiral round or oval duct for low noise consideration and sealing capabilities. Rectangular duct in these pressure ranges need to be sealed at all joints transverse or longitudinal with high pressure liquid duct sealant. All duct sections shall be tested for leakage as part of the work.
14. Masonry or composition walls shall not be used in lieu of sheet metal for exhaust systems in multi-story buildings.
15. Place volume damper locations at accessible points and at a distance no closer than five duct diameters from duct transitions or fittings. Ensure that sheet metal fasteners do not protrude into duct and interfere with damper operation.
16. Size the duct split fittings or branches based on cfm requirements of each resulting duct. When uneven duct pressures result in the branches and outlets, readjust the proportions of the split.
17. Provide dampers at all duct split fittings to permit balancing without raising noise levels. However, these dampers do not eliminate the necessity for volume dampers in the resulting branch ducts.
18. Built-up Air Handling Units shall be welded or soldered, depending on material and/or application. The system shall be pressurized to a minimum of 2 inches water column positive and all joints, seams, gaskets, fittings, etc. tested for leakage with soap solution. All testing shall be witnessed and approved by the WSU Construction Manager. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to provide all leakage test equipment and make all necessary system changes, modifications, and repairs to achieve a successful zero-leakage test. Consult with WSU Engineering Services for specific applications.
19. Utilize equal friction method for duct sizing, not static regain method.
