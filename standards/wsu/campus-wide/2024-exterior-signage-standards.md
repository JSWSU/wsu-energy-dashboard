INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND & PRINCIPLES

BACKGROUND
In 2000 and 2001 WSU Capital Planning and Development worked with WPA, an architecture and graphics firm to create a signage and wayfinding program for the WSU Pullman Campus. This involved an extensive inventory along Stadium Way, and the loop road along Colorado and Spokane Streets. The university was in the process of upgrading the infrastructure along Stadium Way to improve pedestrian safety. The consultants developed new building identity blade signs, street signs, and pedestrian signs. This e ort began the momentum for updating the branding and image of the WSU system statewide.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Exterior Signage Standard is to establish a uniform exterior signage strategy which promotes consistent content delivery and graphic identity to enhance wayfinding throughout the WSU system statewide.

The WSU visual brand consists of four elements: Logos, Typography, Colors, and Graphics. To view WSU's brand identity standards, please visit brand.wsu.edu

GUIDING PRINCIPLES Adhering to the requirements within these standards will establish a signage methodology that uniformly implements WSU's Exterior Signage Program and includes the following:  Promotes wayfinding and a consistent navigable environment on campus.  Unifies the campus and enhances the university's identity, character, and sense of place.  Campus character as a whole is more important than any individual element. Uniformity supports the "look" of the campus.
2

INTRODUCTION
ADMIN. & PROCEDURES
Although other campuses may have their own standards, ALL campuses must comply with the WSU visual brand. Consistency in branding helps promote campus wayfinding in a clear unified manner.

ADMINISTRATION & PROCEDURES
The WSU Signage Standard program establishes standards for design, construction, implementation, and replacement of all permanent exterior signs on WSU's campuses. Temporary signage and appropriate use for signage is addressed through this process.
For construction and large exterior renovations under contract, signage shall be the responsibility of the General Contractor.
Facilities Services updates identity blade signs if the building name changes or if the Dean's o ce moves in or out of the building. Other reasons for requesting updated building identification signs will require the requesting department to fund the new signage/update. Cost for replacement and supplementary signage will be charged to the requesting department or the project budget.
To request services for exterior signage or temporary signage please submit a work request at your campus's Facilities department.
Signage requests that do not meet the requirements established within this document are subject for approval by Facilities Services.

AUTHORITY
WSU Facilities Services oversees the exterior signage program for all system wide properties.
BPPM's have been adopted to address signage standards. These are reviewed periodically to keep current signage standards up to date. Please reference Chapter 20: Property, and Chapter 30: Finance, in the BPPM's for more information. Specifically,

TYPOGRAPHY
Use the Proxima Nova font family for all code required building signage (i.e. identification, area of refuge, life safety, etc.) Signs that are not required by code should still utilize one of the 7 Proxima Nova fonts unless other fonts are approved by University Communications & WSU Brand.

BRAND
LOGOS
Communicating a compelling brand creates a consistent impression of the University.
Visit brand.wsu.edu/logos/ for more information.

LOGOS

The core WSU visual identity consists of three components and use of these components is required to ensure consistency of brand presentation:
1. WSU Signature (logotype) 2. Typography 3. Color Palette - Depending on the background, we o er color variations, ensuring that applications of the core logo have the same visual fidelity
anywhere someone encounters the WSU brand.

COUGAR HEAD

CORE LOGOS

The Cougar head is the primary representation of the brand and most recognizable visual symbol of the university. The graphic beloved by Cougs was created by WSU student Randall Johnson in 1936. Reinforcement of our primary identity builds brand equity, so the Cougar head should be used as the primary graphic identifier of the university in all communications.

The WSU logo pairs the cougar head with our hybrid typeface (WSU). It's the centerpiece of our visual identity. It acts as a signature, an identifier, and the most visible representative of Washington State University. Everything is designed to flow from it. Every application is designed to align with it. And every piece of communication is strengthened by its consistent use.
The wordmark (Washington State University) is based on the Proxima Nova typeface. The "Washington State University" type has been customized, converted to outline, and registered as an o cial brand logo for WSU. Do not try to recreate the wordmark. Use only the o cial horizontal or vertical lockups as provided.

HORIZONTAL LOCKUPS

VERTICAL LOCKUPS

Has three components that are always together, united to clearly and consistently register our brand:
1. The Cougar Head, 2. The custom-created Washington State University wordmark, and 3. A single line dividing the two.

SIGN TYPES
WA. STATE D.O.T. SIGNAGE
Regulatory D.O.T. signs use the Highway Gothic sans-serif typeface developed by the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
These Regulatory Signs may share a sign pole. If they are located near a pedestrian walkway, the bottom of the lowest sign needs to be 7 feet above the paved surface.
The dimensions provided for these signs are typical for campus streets but confirm recommended size with the current edition of MUTCD.

REGULATORY MALL SIGNS Campus pedestrian malls are to include signs limiting vehicular access. R5-1 `DO NOT ENTER' signs and R5-11 `AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY' signs are recommended by the Washington State Department of Transportation (D.O.T) for prohibiting tra c from entering restricted roadways. More information on these regulatory signs can be found in the Manual on Uniform Tra c Control Devices (MUTCD).

SIGN TYPES
IDENTITY SIGNAGE
Blade Signs are to include only the building name and the Dean's o ce location if applicable.
Used to identify academic and primary buildings.

BLADE SIGNS
Identity Blade Signs are used so motorists and pedestrians can identify buildings. These signs are placed near the building's main entry/exit way in connection to a roadway and/or a pedestrian path. Blade signs used near roadways are typically larger than blade signs used near pedestrian walkways in the cores of WSU campuses.

TOBACCO FREE CAMPUS SIGNS
Washington State University is a tobacco free institution. All tobacco products are not allowed on any WSU property. WSU Facilities Services has developed signage strategies for placing Tobacco Free Signage. These locations include bus shelters, on both ends of recycling stations, and parking lot signage. Preference is to not mount directly to building structures, this can be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

DONOR RECOGNITION & MEMORIAL DEDICATION

WSU campuses have developed Campus Beautification and Recognition Programs to celebrate a person, group, or a significant event directly a liated with Washington State University. Donating financial resources for the purchase and maintenance of benches or trees to a WSU campus provides practical and beautiful landscape elements, while the generosity of donors is recognized. The following 2" x 6" and 5" x 6" sample configurations below are the aluminum plaques used for bench recognition and dedication. Wording is to be approved by WSU Facilities Services who are responsible to review with the appropriate stakeholders. See BPPM 30.73 for more information:

State Art Collections and recognition plaques are managed by the WSU Campus Art Committee. They can be referenced to review art plaque text when art installations are donated by private artists.
Exterior Art Plaques can be mounted on knee high poles but typically, they are mounted in concrete. Do Not mount plaques in lawn areas or where they may obstruct snowplows.

ART RECOGNITION PLAQUES
WSU campuses may provide recognition plaques for exterior art installations. The example plaque below is sized at 8" x 10", but exterior art plaques may vary in size depending on the text.
