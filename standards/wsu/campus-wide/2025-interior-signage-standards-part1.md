INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE & PRINCIPLES
The WSU visual brand consists of four elements: logos, typography, colors, and graphics. To view WSU's brand identity standards, please visit brand.wsu.edu.
COMPLIANCE & PROCEDURES
Although other campuses may have their own standards, all campuses must comply with the WSU visual brand. Consistency in branding helps promote campus wayfinding in a clear unified manner.
WSU athletics related signage may be subject to the Cougar Athletics Brand Identity Guidelines. Contact Cougar Athletics Creative Services for more information.

PURPOSE
The purpose of the Interior Signage Standard is to establish a uniform interior signage strategy which promotes consistent content delivery and graphic identity to enhance wayfinding throughout facilities on the WSU Pullman campus. It may be used as a guideline for other WSU campuses as well.
This document is intended to provide a standard on interior signage requirements for WSU's Pullman campus and other WSU campuses that have adopted these standards.
COMPLIANCE
Signage shall be manufactured and installed in accordance with this document, WSU's Signage Policies, and the codes and standards adopted by local, state, and federal government. Adopted state and federal regulations shall take precedence where discrepancies arise between the regulations and this document. Questions and concerns about compliance may be directed to Facilities Services. International Building Code (IBC) Washington State Building Code ICC/ANSI A 117.1 Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities International Fire Code ADA Standards for Accessible Design WSU Standards and Policies
WSU Brand Identity Program Temporary Signage Policy- BPPM 20.43 Postings Policy- BPPM 20.39

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Adhering to the requirements within these standards will establish a signage methodology that uniformly implements WSU's interior signage program and achieves the following:
1) Promotes wayfinding and a consistent navigable environment.
2) Unifies the campus and enhances the university's identity, character, and sense of place.
3) Enables WSU Facilities Services to be more responsive to signage requests.
INTERIOR SIGNAGE PROCEDURES
For all new construction and interior remodels under contract signage shall be the responsibility of the General Contractor.
In existing buildings, updates, and modifications of existing signage may be requested to reflect personnel changes, department relocations, and other changes within buildings. All supplementary and replacement interior signage shall be manufactured and installed by Facilities Services Sign Shop. To request services for interior signage or temporary signage please submit a work request at myfacilities.wsu.edu
Cost for replacement and supplementary signage will be charged to the department or project budget.
Signage requests that do not meet the requirements established within this document are subject to approval by the Design Review Committee.

KIT OF PARTS
MATERIALS

PVC SUBSTRATE

For projects installing new signage throughout the entire building, utilize one material option for all required building signage.
When signs are being added or updated, the new signs shall match the material of the existing signage throughout the building.

Matte Black

Blue

Finishes: Matte black, ADA blue Thickness: 0.25"

BRUSHED ALUMINUM SUBSTRATE

Hairline brushed aluminum finish Thickness: 0.25"

VINYL LETTERING
Common applications for vinyl lettering are building addresses and hours, department names and hours, and special-use room names. Lettering is available in white or black. Choose the color that provides the most contrast with respect to the background and reflections at each location.
Vinyl lettering may be used on glass to supplement building signage at approved locations.
RAISED LETTERING

CLINGS
Wall clings shall comply with the university's brand standards and are subject to approval by University Communications and the Design Review Committee. Clings can be used to provide information about a room or space, such as rules or instructions; however, text must comply with the requirements for informational signs which is outlined in Kit of PartsTypography. Clings shall not be used for identification signage, directional signage, or where signs are required by code.
PHOTOLUMINESCENT

IDENTIFIERS
WSU standardizes room numbering and naming to maintain consistency throughout buildings and enhance wayfinding on campus.
The WSU project manager will provide the design consultant with the finalized room numbering and floor naming scheme developed by WSU Space Management prior to finalization of the design development phase.

ROOM IDENTIFIER
G45A
Typical room numbering strategy for WSU buildings. Room G45A is located on the ground floor within room G45.
F12A
Typical room numbering strategy for apartments. Room F12A is located in unit 12 within Building F.
SECONDARY ROOM IDENTIFIER
A letter su x shall be added to identify a secondary room within a primary room. Where multiple secondary rooms exist within one room, su xes shall start with the letter A and proceed through the alphabet.

FLOOR IDENTIFIER
The first character in the room number for academic buildings indicates the floor on which the room is located:
B = Basement G = Ground M = Mezzanine P = Penthouse # = Floor Numbers
APARTMENT BUILDING IDENTIFIER
University apartment buildings typically utilize a letter prefix to identify the building in which units are located.
APARTMENT UNIT IDENTIFIER
Each apartment is assigned a unit number following the building identifier. Rooms within each unit shall be treated as secondary rooms.

This section categorizes WSU's building signage into four main groups based on their function and code requirements. Technical

drawings follow each overview and provide graphic layouts and basic code requirements for the selected signs. Adhering to these

guidelines ensures signage at WSU meets federal and state requirements. Adopted state and federal regulations shall take

precedence where discrepancies arise between their requirements and this document.
