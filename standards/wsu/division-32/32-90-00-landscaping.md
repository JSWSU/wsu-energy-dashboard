DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A. Selection of Plant Materials:
1. The LA Designer shall submit a preliminary planting plan not later than the 50% Design Development document submittal. Plan shall be reviewed by the WSU Grounds Staff and LA Professional Staff, coordinated by the WSU PM. The plan shall include, but is not limited to:
i. A list of all plants intended to be used on site, identified by botanical and common names, including variety and their intended functions.
ii. The location of all plants on the Landscape Plan.
B. Safety:
1. Human health, safety, security, accessibility and welfare shall be the primary considerations in all Landscape Architecture design.
2. Visibility:
i. Landscaping shall not inhibit area lighting and visibility, or provide hiding places. Consideration shall be given to visibility requirements at vehicular traffic and pedestrian sight lines. Visibility shall not be inhibited by new planting or future growth.
3. Pedestrian Hazards:
i. Designs shall not allow buildup of ice or mud on constructed pedestrian surfaces. Ensure no unsafe conditions are created, especially in the winter when daily freeze/thaw cycles can create icy pedestrian surface conditions and/or damage constructed elements.
1) Design for management of surface flow from irrigation, precipitation, and ice/snowmelt.
2) Prevent surface flow or runoff from moving over any constructed pedestrian surface.
3) Pay particular attention to drainage next to stairs, especially those equipped with automatic snowmelt.

ii. Fruiting and cone-bearing trees and plants shall not be used near paved pedestrian surfaces. Their use is allowed in turf or grasscovered pedestrian areas, except for conifers bearing large cones (greater than 4­inches long) which can interfere with mowers.

4. Plant Placement:
i. Obstructions and Damage: Do not site plant material next to building air exhausts or building air intakes. Do not site plants so that they block access to or function of emergency equipment, maintenance access or security equipment. Do not use species next to constructed surfaces that will develop root systems that will heave, crack or otherwise damage those surfaces.
ii. Poisonous or Dangerous: Do not locate plants that pose physical or chemical hazards in the campus core, next to child care facilities, campus housing or in proximity to any pedestrian traffic. In areas adjacent to agricultural or veterinary livestock do not specify plants that pose a physical or chemical hazard to any animals.
iii. Pest Management: Leave at least a three foot bare swath of ground around structures to minimize pest harborage and pests entering buildings.
C. Landscape Grading and Drainage:
1. Coordinate all landscape grading and drainage with civil designs. Components shall be compatible with existing campus grading and drainage systems (see Section 33 40 00 "Storm Drainage Utilities") and approved by the WSU Project Manager and WSU Landscape Architect staff.
2. Slopes shall be carefully considered with regard to maintenance constraints, stormwater management, snow melt management, and human safety.
3. Drainage:
i. Minimum grades shall ensure adequate surface drainage, with 25:1 (4%) being the preferred minimum in drainage areas.

GENERAL

A. Chemical Usage: Contractor shall coordinate with the Facilities Services CM to notify those on the Chemical Sensitivity Notification List.

B. Plant Material Substitution: If a specified plant cannot be obtained, coordinate substitution through the WSU CM, for approval by the WSU Grounds Staff or LA Professional Staff.

PART 3 - EXECUTION

PROTECTION

A. Existing Trees and Plants

1. Existing plants designated to remain on the project site or adjacent to the project site shall be protected from all project activities, including chemical use and shut-off of irrigation.

2. The Contractor shall be responsible for the protection of existing plants. Existing trees shall have their "Critical Root Zone" (CRZ) protected from any construction disturbance. The CRZ is defined as a circle around the trunk that is one (1) foot in radius for every one (1) inch of trunk diameter measured 4-1/2 feet above grade (Diameter at Breast Height, DBH). In the case of trees with significant importance to the campus as determined by WSU Grounds or Landscape Architecture staff, the CRZ may be increased up to one and one-half (1.5) foot radius for every one (1) inch in DBH. In no case shall the CRZ be less than eight (8) feet. Exceptions need to be approved by WSU PM or CM prior to execution.

3. WSU will evaluate and establish a replacement value for all trees within the construction site prior to the start of construction activities. In addition, the WSU PM or CM shall document construction related damages and shall notify the WSU Grounds Staff or Landscape Architect Staff to assess tree damage. In general, any tree or other type of plant that has suffered damage that threatens its viable structure as a consequence of construction-related activities shall be considered for replacement. WSU

will determine whether Direct Replacement, Assessed Valuation, or a combination will be used.
i. Tree Valuation: The tree assessment and replacement value shall be established using the International Society of Arboriculture Guidelines and the WSU Tree Removal and Replacement Policy (see Appendix A of Section 32 93 43 "Trees").
ii. Direct Replacement: Plants shall be replaced commensurate with their value. Replacement plants shall be installed using the same procedures, specifications, grading standards, and warranty as required for installation of new plants, at no cost to WSU.
iii. Assessed Valuation: The Contractor shall be assessed damages in accordance with established values in the WSU Tree Removal and Replacement Policy.
4. If Contractor damages areas outside the contract limit, the Contractor shall fully restore these areas to their original condition, at no cost to WSU.
B. Newly Planted Plants: Protection of newly planted plants shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. WSU will exercise its right to reject plantings that have been impacted or compromised.
C. Roots:
1. No equipment, material stockpiling, equipment/material wash-down or maintenance drainage, chemical dispersing or work shall be permitted within the CRZ. No fluids or chemicals (wet or dry) brought to the site shall be allowed to move into the CRZ by either surface flow, subsurface flow, or wind, unless intended for use within the CRZ and applied in accordance with the project specifications and manufacturer's instructions.
2. Removal of Interfering Roots, Stems and Trimmings: Removal of interfering roots and branches shall be supervised by WSU Grounds Staff or LA Professional Staff.
3. Open trenches shall not be routed within the CRZ of plants that are to be preserved.
