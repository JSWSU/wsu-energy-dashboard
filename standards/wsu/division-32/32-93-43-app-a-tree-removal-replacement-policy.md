WSU Tree Removal & Replacement Policy

January 21, 2016

Washington State University recognizes the importance of preserving and protecting our campus trees whenever and wherever possible. Trees are a valuable resource and reflect a substantial investment by the University. Trees provide shade, help delineate space, moderate the microclimate, act as landmarks, aid in erosion control, and are socially significant to many students and staff. Each generation has a responsibility to protect and enhance the University's investment.

However, in reality, many Major and Minor Capital Projects or University department or college-funded projects require the removal of trees or at a minimum may have an impact on trees. In addition, trees reach the end of their normal life span and deteriorate. The following procedures identify the required steps prior to any tree removal, including those funded by University departments or colleges, and the policies to fund Tree Replacements.

I. REMOVALS

A. PROCEDURES: During a Major Capital Project, Minor Capital Project or a University department or college-funded project, trees will be retained and preserved whenever possible, and protection provided during construction as specified in the WSU Design and Construction Standards (found on the Facilities Services website: http://facilitiesservices.wsu.edu/constructStandard.aspx#, under Division 32 ­ Exterior Improvements, 32 93 43 Trees and 32 90 00 Landscaping).

1. Major Capital Projects

a) The Project Manager will walk the project site with the Campus Tree Committee at the start of the Pre-Design phase to solicit advice to the desirability of removing trees and of options for retaining existing trees on the site. The Campus Tree Committee shall provide the Project Manager with a list of historic, memorial, or significant trees on or near the project site, if such information exists.

b) Designs will be presented to the Campus Tree Committee at 100% Schematic Design stage, 100% Design Development stage, and 50% Construction Document stage for comment on tree removals, tree protection, and proposed new tree plantings. The Project Manager will be responsible to notify the Campus Tree Committee in writing a minimum of two weeks prior to any submission deadlines, to allow for adequate review and response time.

c) The Project Manager will provide the Campus Tree Committee with a detailed written justification for tree removals

prior to the start of construction, and at least two weeks prior to any tree removal.

d) If change orders or unexpected situations arise during construction that may adversely impact a tree previously scheduled for protection, the Campus Tree Committee will be contacted for comment prior to continuation of that work.

2. Minor Capital Projects

a) The Project Manager will walk the project site with the Campus Tree Committee at the start of the Site Plan Development phase to solicit advice to the desirability of removing trees and of options for retaining existing trees on the site. The Campus Tree Committee shall provide the Project Manager with a list of historic, memorial, or significant trees on or near the project site, if such information exists.

b) Designs will be presented to the Campus Tree Committee at 90% Construction Document phase, or more often as needed, for comment on tree removals, tree protection, and proposed new tree plantings. The Project Manager will be responsible to notify the Campus Tree Committee in writing a minimum of a week prior to any submission deadlines, to allow for adequate review and response time.

c) The Project Manager will provide the Campus Tree Committee with a detailed written justification for tree removals prior to the start of construction, and at least two weeks prior to any tree removal.

d) If change orders or unexpected situations arise during construction that may adversely impact a tree previously scheduled for protection, the Campus Tree Committee will be contacted for comment prior to continuation of that work.

3. University department or college-funded projects

a) A University department or college representative will walk the project site with the Campus Tree Committee to solicit advice to the desirability of removing trees and of options for retaining existing trees on the site. The Campus Tree Committee shall provide the University department or college representative with a list of historic, memorial, or significant trees on or near the project site, if such information exists.

b) A University department or college representative will be responsible to notify the Campus Tree Committee chair in writing a

minimum of two weeks prior to any submission deadlines, to allow for adequate review and response time.

c) The University department or college representative will provide the Campus Tree Committee with a detailed written justification for tree removals prior to the start of construction, and at least two weeks prior to any tree removal.

d) If unexpected situations arise after the Campus Tree Committee has provided comment on the project that may affect other nearby trees, the Campus Tree Committee will be contacted for comment prior to the continuation of that work.

4. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS: All recommendations provided by the Campus Tree Committee will be documented in writing within a week after the review. If the Campus Tree Committee disagrees with the need for tree removal, a final decision may be made by the Vice President for Finance and Administration through the Associate Vice President of Facilities Services.

B. TREE RELOCATION: Where existing trees interfere with proposed construction or renovation, tree relocation shall be considered as an option. The viability of tree relocations should be made based on the value of the tree, the cost of relocation, and the probability of survival after the relocation.

C. WEEKEND REMOVAL: Due to safety concerns, trees may be removed on weekends and on holidays.

D. CAMPUS ANNOUNCEMENTS: The Project Manager or the administration of the campus unit responsible for removing the tree, if no Project Manager is associated with the project, will place a notice on WSU Today, WSU Announcements and myFacilities work order system (https://myfacilities.wsu.edu/) of all tree removals. Such notice shall be displayed on WSU Today, WSU Announcements and myFacilities at least five working days prior to removal, unless life safety issues or imminent facility damage dictate immediate removal. The announcement will include tree location, tree species, justification for removal, and estimated time frame for removal, and if there will be a replacement in the same vicinity or elsewhere. The Project Manager or administration of the responsible campus unit will be listed as the contact person in the notice.

1. In the case of a tree associated with one or more facilities, the Project Manager or administration of the responsible campus unit will notify in writing the Dean and/or Chair of the building programs with the same information placed in the announcement.

E. TREE VALUATION: When trees are to be removed as part of a Major Capital Project, Minor Capital Project, or University department or college-funded project, they will be identified and valued by the campus arborist, a designated

member of Facilities Services' staff prior to removal. Tree values will be calculated based on best management practices, and should consider the age, location, and condition of the tree as well as any special or unusual characteristics.
F. REUSE OF WOOD: Consideration shall be given to the reuse of the wood from trees with particular value to the campus or to the community. If such reuse has been advocated by the Tree Committee, then any additional costs incurred by the project to reuse the wood as recommended by the Tree Committee will be added to the replacement landscape costs of the project.
1. Wood from trees having cultural, historic, or memorial value may be recycled for use in a prominent location on the project (eg, as a bench, a table, a wall surface/decoration, an art piece, etc).
2. Valuable wood may be sold via Surplus Stores or other means available to the University.
II. TREE REPLACEMENT
A. TREE REPLACEMENT FUND: When the value of trees to be removed exceeds the cost of plant materials and irrigation for a proposed project, the project budget will fund the difference between the tree value and the landscape cost. These moneys will be put into a Tree Replacement fund(s) that will be used only for the purchase and installation of future trees and associated irrigation, if necessary, to support tree survivability, growth and vigor.
1. The landscape program for a Project includes ONLY tree replacement, other plant materials (excluding athletic and playfield turf), and irrigation.
a) Example 1: The Plant and Irrigation portion of the landscape costs for Project N is $50,000. The value of trees and irrigation to be removed is $65,000. The difference of $15,000 will be charged to the project and placed into a Tree Replacement fund.
b) Example 2: The Plant and Irrigation portion of the landscape costs for Project L is $50,000. The value of trees and irrigation to be removed is $35,000. No funds remain to be placed into a Tree Replacement fund since the landscape program exceeds the value of lost trees.
2. At the end of the Project, the Project Manager or Department or College representative will compile the final cost of trees, other plant material, and irrigation and provide that information to the Campus Tree Committee. The amount of moneys going into the Tree Replacement Fund(s) shall also be identified.

3. Tree Replacement moneys that exceed the landscape costs of Major Capital Projects will be placed into a Tree Replacement Fund managed by Capital Planning and Development. Tree Replacement moneys that exceed the landscape costs of Minor Capital Projects will be placed into a Tree Replacement Fund managed by Facilities Operations. Tree Replacement moneys that exceed the landscape costs of University departments or colleges projects will be placed into the Tree Replacement Fund managed by either Facilities Operations or Capital Planning and Development, depending on which organization supervised the project.
4. Upon a request from the Campus Arboretum Committee, the Campus Tree Committee, and/or Campus arborists, and upon recommendation from Facilities Services Landscape staff, the University Architect may approve utilization of the Tree Replacement funds to purchase and install trees in appropriate locations on the campus. Written notification will be given to the Campus Tree Committee in the event of such usage regardless of the source of requests or recommendations.
B. REPLACEMENT LOCATION: It is understood that it may not be feasible to replace trees on a one-to-one ratio, or that trees removed from a site may not be replaced at that same site. The purpose of this policy is to facilitate preservation of trees on WSU's campus in the spirit of no net loss of tree canopy and, when possible, increasing the amount of canopy. Thus, moneys from the Tree Replacement funds may contribute to trees in a location on the Pullman campus separate from a construction project.
C. REMOVAL DUE TO DISEASE: Tree removal that is necessitated by disease, death or emergency safety concerns are not subject to the Tree Replacement Fund requirements.
D. DEPARTMENT OR COLLEGE REQUESTS: Live tree removals requested by departments or colleges other than those responsible for Major or Minor Capital Projects will subject that department or college to comply with this Tree Removal and Replacement Policy and to fund tree replacements.
