PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 SCOPE
A. Specific details of vehicular pavements, exterior slabs, sidewalks, and curbs constructed of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) are also addressed in WSU Design Standard 32 13 13 "Concrete Paving."
1.02 Design Criteria
A. Concrete Strength: The Engineer of Record shall specify the required concrete strength for all applications. Specify the following 28-day compressive strengths, at a minimum:
1. Interior Concrete: 3000 psi minimum
2. Exterior Concrete Exposed to Freeze/Thaw: 4500 psi minimum
i. Water Cement Ratio < 0.45 for exterior concrete exposed to freeze/thaw
B. Air Entrainment: Specify air entrainment 5 ­ 8% for all exterior concrete.
1. For color-dyed concrete, Engineer of Record shall specify the air entrainment required.
C. Joints:
1. General: Construct joints true to line with faces perpendicular to surface plane of concrete.
2. Control Joints:
i. Install control joints as close to square as possible. Score at least onequarter the depth of the concrete pavement. Joints may be sawcut or tooled, but sawcutting shall be done within 24 hours of concrete placement.
3. Construction Joints: The Architect or Engineer of Record shall indicate or approve locations. Install so strength and appearance of concrete are not impaired.
i. Place joints perpendicular to main reinforcement. Continue reinforcement across construction joints unless otherwise specified by the Engineer of Record.

ii. Horizontal Joints: Locate in walls and columns at the underside of floors, slabs, beams, and girders and at the top of footings or floor slabs.
iii. Vertical Joints: Locate joints beside piers integral with walls, near corners, and in concealed locations where possible.
iv. Bonded Joints: Use a bonding agent at locations where fresh concrete is placed against hardened or partially hardened concrete surfaces. The hardened concrete surface shall first be roughened in a manner that exposes sound aggregate uniformly without damaging the concrete.
v. Waterstops: Install in Construction Joints to form a continuous diaphragm. Install in longest lengths possible.
4. Expansion Joints: Engineer of Record shall indicate locations, distances, and depths.
i. Place expansion joints, at a minimum:
1) At intersections between different paving materials, 2) Where concrete paving abuts structures (buildings, retaining walls,
etc.).
ii. Discontinue reinforcement at Expansion Joints unless otherwise indicated by the Engineer of Record.
iii. Joint-Filler Strips: Install full width and depth of joint, terminating flush with the finished concrete surface. Install joint-filler strips in lengths as long as possible. Where more than one strip is required, lace or clip sections together.
5. Doweled Joints: Engineer of Record shall indicate locations.
i. Lubricate or asphalt coat half the dowel length to prevent concrete bonding to one side of the joint.
D. Finishes:
1. The finish surface of all concrete shall be uniform in texture, smooth, and free of hollows, depressions, and surface cracks.
2. Finish Requirements for Exterior Walks, Stairs, Ramps: Provide with heavy broom finish, with the broom texture perpendicular to traffic flow. Top flat flange marks of scoring tools and edgers shall be obliterated with
