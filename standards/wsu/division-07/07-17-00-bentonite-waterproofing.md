B. For use in blindside conditions on retained earth or where shotcrete/gunite is scheduled to be blown directly onto the membrane face, provide "Paramount Paraseal LG Membrane," which is the Paraseal Membrane with additional protective laminate layer of spun polypropylene.
2.03 ACCESSORIES
A. For installation at horizontal to vertical junctures, provide "Paramount Paragranular" loose bentonite granules in weatherproof 50 lb. bags and capable of swelling to occupy a minimum volume of 17 ml when 2 grams are dispersed into deionized water.
B. For detailing vertical junctures and penetrations, provide "Paramount Paramastic" non hydrated expandable mastic of trowelable consistency containing not less than 55% high swelling Wyoming sodium-bentonite.
C. Provide the Following Seam Tapes as Needed:
1. "Temporary Tape" reinforced temporary joint closure tape 3 inches wide composed of acrylic adhesive bonded to polyvinyl chloride coated fabric used to protect seams against debris intrusion during backfill and for temporary terminations during periods of exposure to rain.
2. "Permanent Seam Tape" reinforced, rubberized asphaltic waterproofing seam tape 4 inches wide by 60 mils thick for sealing membrane overlaps wherever flood testing is required and elsewhere as required by Project conditions or designs.
3. "Para JT Tape" non reinforced, adhesive tape of partially cross linked polymeric elastomers 2 inches wide by 1/8 inch thick for molding form fit seals around difficult contours and for taping seams within overlaps.
D. Provide "Paramount Paraterm Bar" extruded aluminum bar with upper flange to receive sealant for terminations at grade line and on parapet walls.
E. Provide "Vulkem 116/227 Sealant" one or two part, gun grade polyurethane sealant for completing termination seals and other sealing recommended by manufacturer.
