DIVISION 14 ­ CONVEYING EQUIPMENT 14 20 00 ELEVATORS
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. References: All designs shall comply with the most current version of the following:
1. ASME A17.1 (2013 edition)
2. WAC 296-96
3. Where these two codes conflict, WAC 296-96 shall take precedent.
B. General Guidelines: Design Consultants shall note that University elevators are subject to continuous full-capacity service, are prone to vandalism, and are required to provide access for the disabled to most building areas. It is imperative that elevators be designed accordingly.
C. All new buildings shall be designed with a minimum of two elevators. Deviation from this standard requires approval by the WSU Project Manager. Consultants shall address this issue with the WSU Project Manager and WSU Engineering Services as early as possible in the design process.
1. At least one elevator per building shall be large enough to accommodate a medical gurney.
D. Specify hydraulic elevator(s) unless project conditions make this unfeasible. Hydraulic elevators have proven the most cost effective solution for long-term maintenance on the WSU campus. Design and selection of other elevator systems requires approval from WSU Engineering Services.
E. Elevator equipment and controls shall not be located in the hoistway; maintenance of these designs is prohibitively expensive.
F. Elevators shall be designed for combination passenger and freight (Class A) service. No exceptions.
G. Freight and Equipment Transportation: At least one elevator shall access all floors of the buildings, including the mechanical room and penthouse. Coordinate elevator design with the Mechanical Engineer consultant so that all equipment can be transported to loading dock facilities via the elevators.
H. Alarms and Emergency Communication:
1. Inside Machine Room: Provide dedicated analog line to outside communications.

DIVISION 14 ­ CONVEYING EQUIPMENT 14 20 00 ELEVATORS
2. Inside Car: Provide dedicated analog line to elevator controller (911 emergency services operator).
i. Install a CAT 6 copper wire from the building telecommunications closet to a WSU Information Technology Services (ITS)-accessible punch block connector in the elevator machine room.
ii. Provide a phone device conforming to ASME A17.1 and capable of receiving a CAT 6 copper wire via shaft traveler and connected to the elevator controller in the machine room. Install a cross connector CAT 6 wire from the controller to the ITS-accessible punch block.
iii. WSU ITS shall provide a dedicated phone circuit from the building telecommunications closet to an analog demark in the Main Communications Facility (MCF). These MCF connections on Cisco Analog Gateways, which are part of the WSU campus phone system and provided with 4-hour minimum power during building-wide or campus-wide power outages.
3. Provide Intercom stations at the Machine Room and Main Egress for communications with car.
I. Access Control: Elevators which serve mechanical spaces, basements, penthouses, roofs or other non-public areas shall be provided with a programmable floor-specific keyless access control system, which shall limit access to authorized personnel only. See details in Section 28 13 00 "Access Control." No elevator shall provide public access to restricted areas.
1.02 WA STATE LABOR AND INDUSTRIES (L&I) ACCEPTANCE
A. Contractor shall be responsible to obtain Washington State Labor and Industries (L&I) inspection and acceptance of elevator materials and installation prior to the delivery of new furniture to the project.
1.03 WARRANTY PERIOD MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
A. Contractor shall be responsible to provide 24/7 callback service coverage with no more than a 60-minute ETA.
B. Billable callback hourly rates shall match the WSU Elevator Maintenance Contract, or shall be outlined and agreed upon in the original contract documents.
C. Contractor shall be responsible for all L&I inspection corrections and penalty fees, at no cost to WSU, throughout the duration of the warranty maintenance period.

DIVISION 14 ­ CONVEYING EQUIPMENT 14 20 00 ELEVATORS
A. The elevator control shall be a distributed control system, microprocessorbased and software-oriented.
B. The elevator installation shall be a design that can be maintained by any licensed elevator maintenance company employing journeymen mechanics, without the need to purchase or lease additional diagnostic devices, special tools, or instructions from the original equipment Contractor.
C. The new equipment shall meet the following requirements:
1. Provide on-site capability to diagnose faults to the level of individual circuit boards and individual discrete components for the solid state elevator controller.
i. The Contractor shall provide a printed copy of the fault ID codes and diagnostic outline to the WSU Construction Manager upon final acceptance. This information shall also be included in the O&M Manual.
2. Provide a separate detachable device as part of this installation if the equipment for fault diagnosis is not completely self-contained within the controller. This device shall become the property of WSU upon acceptance.
3. If the control system requires a SIMM card or other device, such device shall become the property of WSU upon acceptance.
4. Installed equipment not meeting this requirement shall be removed and replaced with conforming equipment at no cost to WSU.
5. All replacement parts necessary for maintenance and repair must be readily available for purchase and shipment by ANY licensed elevator company to reduce down times.
