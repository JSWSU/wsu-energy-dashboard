2.01 COATING MATERIALS (LABORATORIES AND KITCHENS)
A. New construction: Polyurethane-based primer/coating systems are generally preferred, due to greater thermal and impact resistance.
B. Renovations and Renewals: Facility use and occupancy may limit the project to use of water-based primer/coating systems. Consult with the WSU Project Manager for determination.
C. Primer:
1. Benjamin Moore V156 Moisture Tolerant Fast Set Epoxy Sealer
2. Sherwin Williams Armorseal Water-Based Epoxy Primer/Sealer
3. BASF SRS Degadur System Primer
D. Top Coat:
1. Benjamin Moore Polyester Urethane Gloss V520
2. Benjamin Moore Waterborne Amine Epoxy V440
3. Sherwin Williams Armorseal HS Polyurethane Floor Enamel (self-priming)
4. Sherwin Williams Armorseal Floor-Plex 7100 Water Based Epoxy
5. BASF SRS Degadur System Wearing Layer / Sealcoat
PART 3 - EXECUTION
3.01 DELIVERY, STORAGE & HANDLING
A. Before beginning work, the Contractor shall check all material at the project site for completeness and shipping damage. Containers shall be sealed and clearly marked with manufacturer's name, brand name and type of material as well as color number and or name.
B. Store material in dry, enclosed area protected from sun, cold and moisture. Storage temperatures between 50° and 75° F shall be maintained.
