DIVISION 02 ­ EXISTING CONDITIONS 02 40 00 DEMOLITION AND STRUCTURE MOVING
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 DESIGN CRITERIA
A. When demolition is part of a Construction Contract, the following provisions should be considered for inclusion in the Specifications:
1. WSU Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) will provide good faith survey for asbestos, lead and other hazardous materials.
i. If no asbestos, lead or hazardous materials are present, demolition or structure moving can proceed.
ii. If asbestos is present, then special precautions must be taken prior to demolition:
1) All parties involved in demolition must be informed of the presence, location and amount of asbestos containing materials.
2) All building components containing more than 1% asbestos shall be abated prior to any demolition activity unless a structural engineer has determined the building to be structurally unsound. WSU EH&S must be consulted about demolition of an unsound structure containing asbestos.
3) All building components containing asbestos in concentrations less than 1% shall be managed under a Contractor-provided plan approved by WSU EH&S prior to demolition.
iii. All materials, other than asbestos, determined to be hazardous must be analyzed to determine if they qualify as dangerous waste. All dangerous waste must be managed by WSU EH&S or by the Contractor in coordination with WSU EH&S.
2. Demolition work near housing areas and academic buildings may be limited to project-specific hours of operation. Coordinate with the WSU Construction Manager before scheduling noisy operations (i.e., jack hammering, concrete saw cutting, etc.).
3. Coordinate relocation of desirable trees to areas specified by the WSU Construction Manager. Trees which can be transplanted are to be removed prior to any demolition work phase. Reference Section 32 93 43 "Trees".
1.02 DEBRIS DISPOSAL:
A. All demolition and construction debris shall be removed from site and disposed of in a legal landfill or other legal location.

B. Contractor shall not dispose of any construction debris in any University dumpsters unless contracted with WSU Waste Management for debris disposal.
C. Contractor is responsible for maintaining a written chain of custody for disposal of all hazardous and asbestos-containing materials, and shall furnish record copies to the WSU Construction Manager and Environmental Health and Services (EH&S).
1.03 SALVAGE REQUIREMENTS
A. All items scheduled for removal shall be reviewed by the WSU Construction Manager for potential salvage, per WSU BPPM 20.76.1. Any items determined to be salvageable shall be removed by the Contractor and delivered to WSU Surplus Stores.
1. Potentially hazardous items shall be surveyed by WSU EH&S prior to removal. Salvageable items containing or composed of hazardous materials shall be removed and transported to Surplus Stores in accordance with WSU BPPM 20.77.
B. Remaining items not designated for WSU salvage may become the Contractor's property for removal and legal salvage, if approved by WSU Surplus in accordance with BPPM 20.76.1. Coordinate with the WSU Construction Manager for approval.
1. No item containing hazardous material shall be designated to be Contractor's property unless specifically approved by WSU EH&S.
