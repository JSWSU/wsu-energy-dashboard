the condition to the satisfaction of the Owner including clearance sampling, prior to resumption of work.
B. Protection of Existing Work to Remain: Perform demolition work without damage or contamination of adjacent work. Where such work is damaged or contaminated as verified by the Owner using visual inspection or sample analysis, it shall be restored to its original condition or decontaminated by the Contractor at no expense to the Owner as deemed appropriate by the Owner. This includes inadvertent spill of dirt, dust or debris in which it is reasonable to conclude that asbestos may exist. When these spills occur, stop work immediately. Then clean up the spill. When satisfactory visual inspection and air sampling results are obtained by, or supplied to, the Owner work may proceed.
C.

DIVISION 02 ­ EXISTING CONDITIONS 02 80 00 FACILITY REMEDIATION 02 82 13 ASBESTOS ABATEMENT
Openings will be allowed in enclosures of asbestos control areas for the supply and exhaust of air for the local exhaust system. Replace filters as required to maintain the efficiency of the system.
G. Asbestos Handling Procedures: This section describes the procedures for removal of the asbestos-containing materials and materials that contain less than 1% asbestos, including removal methods, air sampling, and encapsulation or lockdown of remaining fibers. The work procedures referenced herein are to be regarded as informational only for the guidance and clarification of industry accepted work practices and regulatory compliance. The inclusion or omission of a specific work practice or regulatory requirement does not relieve the contractor from responsibility and requirements for performing the work in strict compliance with applicable codes, standards, and regulations, as well as, generally accepted industry practices.
1. Glovebags: Glovebags shall consist of 6 mil plastic bags which are seamless at the bottom. Each glovebag shall be installed so that it completely covers the circumference of the pipe where the work is to be done. The glovebags should be smoke tested for leaks, and any such leaks should be sealed prior to commencement of the abatement activities. Glovebags may be used only once, and may not be moved. Glovebags shall not be used on surfaces whose temperature exceeds 150 degrees F. Where unusual circumstances prohibit the use of 6 mil plastic bags, submit an alternate proposal for containment of asbestos fibers to the Owner's Consultant for approval. For example, in the case where both piping and insulation are to be removed, the Contractor may elect to wet the insulation and wrap the pipes and insulation in plastic and remove the pipe by sections. Wet asbestos material with a fine spray of amended water prior to and during removal, cutting, or other handling so to reduce the emission of airborne fibers. Remove material and drop into the 6 mil plastic disposal bags hanging from the pipes. Prior to disposal, glovebags shall be collapsed by removing the air within them using a HEPA vacuum.
2. Vinyl Flooring - Flooring or its backing shall not be sanded. Vacuums equipped with HEPA filter, disposable dust bag, and metal floor tool (no brush) shall be used to clean floors. Resilient sheeting shall be removed by cutting with wetting of the snip point and wetting during delaminating. Rip-up of resilient sheet floor material is prohibited. All scraping of residual adhesives and/or backing shall be performed using wet methods. Dry sweeping is prohibited. Mechanical chipping is prohibited unless performed in a negative pressure enclosure which meets the requirements of WAC 296-62-07712 (7) (a). Plastic sheeting shall be applied to walls and other vertical surfaces from the floor to a height of four feet to prevent damage (e.g., staining) due to incidental splashing of mastic remover.

3. Roofing: Roofing material shall be removed in an intact state to the extent feasible. Wet methods shall be used to remove roofing materials that are not intact, or that will be rendered not intact during removal, unless the contractor can demonstrate to the Owner that such wet methods are not feasible or will create safety hazards. Roofing material debris shall be lowered to the ground by hand, crane, or hoist, alternatively, a dust-tight chute may be used. In any case, removed roofing debris shall be lowered to the ground prior to the end of the work shift and placed in a closed receptacle. Roof level heating and ventilation intakes shall be isolated or the ventilation system shut down during roof removal. Demolition of the buildings with the roofing material in place shall be conducted in accordance with requirements detailed in Washington State Department of Labor and Industries Regional Directive 23.35 Demolition of Buildings with Asbestos-Containing Materials.
4. Cement Asbestos Board: Cutting, abrading or breaking cement asbestos board (a.k.a. transite panel) is prohibited unless it can be demonstrated to the Owner that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release cannot be used. Each panel must be sprayed with amended water prior to removal. Unwrapped or unbagged panels must be immediately lowered, not dropped, to the ground or placed in an impervious waste bag of wrapped in plastic sheeting and lowered to the ground no later than the end of the work shift.
5. Materials that contain less than 1% asbestos: Although not regulated as an asbestos project, disturbing materials with <1% asbestos requires a state certified Supervisor/Competent person to be present per WAC 29662-07728, and the use of basic asbestos work practices outlined in WAC 296-62-017712(2). Work practices include the use of wet, non-aggressive methods and prompt clean-up. Vacuums used must be HEPA filtered. At a minimum, worker training must include asbestos awareness and hands on training outlined in WAC 296-62-07722(5). Respiratory protection must be used in the absence of a negative exposure assessment to maintain personnel exposures below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).
H. Air Sampling: Sampling airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers for preabatement and clearance shall be performed by the Owner in accordance with WAC 296-62-077 and as specified herein. Personal sampling and area sampling required by WAC 296-62-077 inside and outside the regulated area shall be performed by the Contractor, specifically by personnel qualified to perform such sampling. Sampling performed for environmental, quality control and work acceptance reasons may be performed by the Owner at any time before, during and after work performed by the Contractor. Unless otherwise specified, the NIOSH Method 7400 for sampling and analysis is used. Monitoring may be duplicated by government agencies at the discretion of the

Calibration of the air sampling equipment shall be conducted prior to and after air sampling. Calibration documentation shall be provided to the Owner.
1. Sampling Prior to Asbestos Work: The Contractor shall provide adequate notification to allow the Owner to conduct area air sampling and establish the baseline one day prior to the masking and sealing operations for each removal site. The background may be established by performing area sampling in similar but uncontaminated sites in the building. The Contractor may replicate such sampling at their discretion, at no cost to the Owner.
2. Sampling During Asbestos Work: The Contractor's qualified person shall provide personal sampling as indicated in WAC 296-62-077. At the same time the Contractor's qualified person shall conduct area sampling outside the work area. If applicable, this shall include the clean room entrance to the containment and at the exhaust opening of the local exhaust system. Thereafter, provided the same type of work is being performed, the Contractor's qualified person may limit area sampling to once every work shift alternating between the clean room entrance to the containment and the exhaust opening of the local exhaust system. If sampling outside the containment shows airborne fiber/asbestos fiber concentrations have exceeded background or 0.01 fibers/cc, whichever is greater, stop all work, correct the condition(s) causing the increase, and notify the Owner immediately.
3. Sampling During Demolition of Materials Containing Less than 1% Asbestos: The Contractor's qualified person shall provide personal breathing zone air sampling to evaluate respiratory protection requirements and maintain personnel exposures below the PEL. Sampling protocols must comply with WAC 296-62-07709.
4. Sampling After Final Clean-Up (Clearance Sampling): After final cleanup and the asbestos control area is dry but prior to clearance sampling, the Owner shall perform a visual inspection referencing ASTM E 1368 to verify the asbestos control and work area is free of any accumulations of dirt, dust, or debris. Following the visual inspection, the Owner will provide area sampling of asbestos fibers according to WAC 296-62-077. The Owner will submit written documentation of the visual inspection and clearance sampling to the Contractor within 24 hours from receipt of clearance sample data. Contractor's engineering controls, containment barriers, enclosures and asbestos control areas shall remain intact until

acceptable analytical results of the clearance air monitoring is confirmed by the Owner.
i. Should any of the clearance samples fail to comply with the clearance requirements of WAC 296-62-077 or exceed 0.01 fibers/cc, the Contractor will be notified of the results and instructed to re-clean the area. Upon written notification by the Contractor that the area has been re-cleaned and is ready for clearance testing the Owner will collect an additional set of clearance samples. These procedures will be repeated until the clearance testing is successfully completed. All costs for additional testing required as a result of failed clearance testing will be at the Contractor's expense. When the reported analytical results of the final clearance samples comply with the clearance requirements of WAC 296-62-077 and document airborne fiber concentrations are less than or equal to 0.01 fibers/cc, the Contractor may disassemble the asbestos control area.
I. Visual Acceptance Inspection: After final cleanup and the asbestos control area is dry but prior to clearance sampling, the Owner shall perform a visual inspection referencing ASTM E 1368 to verify the asbestos control and work area is free of any accumulations of dirt, dust, or debris. The Contractor shall notify the Owner that asbestos abatement is complete and the area is ready for the Owner's visual acceptance inspection. The notification shall be in writing and 72 hours prior to the requested date of the Owner's visual acceptance inspection. Should the Contractor fail the Owner's visual acceptance inspection, the Contractor will be instructed to correct the deficiency. Upon written notification by the Contractor the deficiency has been corrected, the Owner will conduct an additional visual acceptance inspection. These procedures will be repeated until an acceptable visual inspection is completed. All costs for additional inspections required as a result of deficiencies will be at the Contractor's expense.
J. Lock Down: Prior to removal of plastic barriers and after pre-clearance clean up of gross contamination, a visual inspection of all areas affected by the removal of the asbestos contaminated materials for any visible fibers, shall be conducted by the designated competent person and submitted in writing to the Owner for approval. A post removal (lock down) encapsulant shall then be spray applied to ceiling, walls, floors and other areas exposed in the removal area. The exposed area shall include but not be limited to plastic barriers, furnishings and articles to be discarded as well as the dirty change room, air locks for bag removal and decontamination chambers.
K. Site Inspection: While performing asbestos removal work, the Contractor shall be subject to on-site inspection by the Owner who may be assisted by or represented by safety or industrial hygiene personnel. If the work is found to

be in violation of this specification, the Owner will issue a stop work order to be in effect immediately and until the violation is resolved. Standby time required to resolve the violation shall be at the Contractor's expense.
3.03 CLEAN-UP AND DISPOSAL
A. Housekeeping: Essential parts of asbestos dust control are housekeeping and clean-up procedures. This includes demolition of materials that contain less than 1% asbestos. Maintain surfaces of the asbestos control area free of accumulations of asbestos fibers. Give meticulous attention to restricting the spread of dust and debris; keep wastes from being distributed over the general area. Use HEPA filtered vacuum cleaners. Do not dry sweep or blow down the space with compressed air.
B. Title to Materials: All materials resulting from asbestos abatement work, except as specified otherwise, shall become the property of the Contractor and shall be disposed of as specified in applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
C. Disposal of Asbestos
1. Cleanup: Collect asbestos waste, including waste that contains less than 1% asbestos, asbestos contaminated water, scrap, debris, bags, containers, equipment and asbestos contaminated clothing and place in sealed fiber-proof, leak-proof, non-returnable containers (e.g. double plastic bags 6 mils thick, cartons, drums or cans). Wastes within the containers must be wetted to insure the security of the material in case of container breaching. Maintain surfaces of the asbestos control area free of accumulations of asbestos fibers. Restrict the spread of dust and debris; keep waste from being distributed over the general area. Do not dry sweep or blow down the space with compressed air. After cleanup, remove filters on the building air handling system in the control area and provide new filters. Handle and dispose of filters and asbestoscontaminated materials. Re-establish HVAC, mechanical, and electrical systems in working order. The Contractor may forego replacement of air handling system pre-filters and the reestablishment of the air handling, mechanical and electrical systems if building demolition is eminent.
D. Removal of Asbestos Waste Containers: Store asbestos waste containers in the asbestos control area until the control area cleanup is complete, or provide a waste container removal system. Asbestos waste containers shall not be removed through the change rooms. The waste container removal system shall consist of a wash-down station inside the asbestos control area, a washroom, and a waste container holding area. Provide caution signs as specified herein for asbestos control areas. The waste container removal

system shall be a temporary unit constructed to prevent the escape of asbestos fibers from the area. Perform cleanup of the waste container removal system as specified herein for enclosed asbestos control areas. Do not remove the waste container removal system enclosure and caution signs prior to the Owner certification of clearance.
E. Disposal of Asbestos: Affix a warning and Department of Transportation (DOT) label to each bag or use at least 6 mil thick bags with the approved warnings and DOT labeling pre-printed on the bag. Dispose of waste asbestos material at an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved sanitary landfill selected by the Owner. For temporary storage, store sealed impermeable bags in asbestos waste drums or skids. The Owner must approve an area for interim storage of asbestos waste-containing drums or skids. Procedure for hauling and disposal shall comply with 40 CFR 61, Subpart M, and state, regional, and local standards. Sealed impermeable bags may be dumped from drums into the burial site unless bags have been broken or damaged. Damaged bags shall remain in the drum and the entire contaminated drum shall be buried. Uncontaminated drums may be recycled. Workers unloading sealed drums shall wear appropriate respirators and personal protective equipment when handling asbestos materials at the disposal site.
