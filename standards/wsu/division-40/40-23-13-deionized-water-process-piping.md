PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 SUMMARY
A. Section includes providing and installing all items necessary for the construction of the header assembly, tanks, fittings, controls and piping necessary to complete the deionization system for new and remodel construction projects.
1.02 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. General:
1. The deionization system shall reduce the total dissolved solids of the water so that the specific resistance of the water generated is not less than 18 megaohms as measured at the resin tanks. The system cannot guarantee delivery of 18 megaohm water throughout the piping network. Higher purity water must be provided by user equipment if further polishing necessary.
2. WSU maintains all deionizing tanks and resin at the Facility Services shops. All resin regeneration and tank flushing is performed by the Facilities Services.
3. Resin standard: USF NR-30 - Mixed Bed Resin or approved equivalent
B. System Description:
1. Deionization systems shall be a two-tank softener system, with carbon filter, reverse osmosis generator, and storage tank for treated water. Distribution system shall be 100% recirculated throughout the building.
2. Distribution within buildings shall include valves to isolate each floor level separately for maintenance and repairs. Air locks and high points should be eliminated wherever possible, and provided with accessible vent valves where required.
C. Deionization system shall be designed and constructed to provide a minimum of three (3) feet clear width for access to all equipment.
1.03 DELIVERY, STORAGE AND HANDLING
A. Contractor shall provide resin tanks, softener media, and associated components with completed system.

B. Complete deionized water system shall be commissioned and producing 18 megaohm water prior to turnover at Substantial Completion.
PART 2 - PRODUCTS
2.01 EQUIPMENT
A. Water Meters:
1. The input raw water to the deionized water system shall be metered to record totalized flow; digital network reporting of this meter not required.
