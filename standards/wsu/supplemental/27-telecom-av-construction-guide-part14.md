Cable lengths shall be kept to practical minimum lengths (not more than 25 ft.), while providing slack for three connector reterminations of the cable on each end of the cable. Avoid long cables that require slack coils. Where slack coils are required, store slack coil under the base of A/V Equipment Rack.

B. All wiring and cables shall be free of grounds and shorts.

C. All wiring and cables shall be properly supported with strain relief measures.

D. The use of nylon tie wraps ("zip-ties") is prohibited everywhere, with the following exceptions: 1. In above-ceiling wire basket cable trays, tie wraps shall be used in the corners (where the cable tray turns) to maintain orderly cable grooming. 2. Permanently affixed power wiring.

E. A/V Equipment Racks: 1. After the system has been completely tested, neatly bundle and dress cables using Velcro-style straps to secure cables against lacing bars in a neat and workmanlike manner. Provide sufficient cable slack such that equipment can be serviced without binding or kinking the cables.
F. Instructor Consoles: 1. After the system has been completely tested, neatly bundle and dress cables using Velcro-style straps with screw-attached bases to secure cables against the underside of the console in a neat and workmanlike manner.

G. Mesh Sleeves: 1. Provide mesh sleeves as listed below, with the ends of the sleeves telescoped/rolled back into the sleeve approximately 4 inches to prevent fraying, and secured with an overwrapping tie-wrap at each end: a. Anywhere cables would be exposed to public view. b. Between floor boxes and conference tables. 2. Prevent mesh sleeves from pulling out of their termination point, thus keeping cabling concealed and protected inside the sleeves.
