Physical Infrastructure for A/V
ACOUSTICS & COLOR
4 Physical Infrastructure for A/V
This section defines and describes the physical infrastructure components that are required to support audio/visual systems for WSUP. The Designer shall design these into the various application spaces (classrooms, conference rooms, etc.) in WSUP facilities as described in Section 6. The Designer shall incorporate this content into the construction drawings and specifications.
4.1 Acoustics & Color
Some A/V applications have more stringent acoustic or color treatment requirements than others. It is dramatically more expensive to retrofit a space with acoustic treatments if they are not provided at the time of original construction. The Designer shall investigate with WSUP the possibility that any of the A/V application spaces in a building might possibly need higher levels of acoustic treatment in the future. If so, such spaces shall be designed for the higher levels of acoustic treatment during original construction. According to the recommendations of ANSI S12.60-2002, a noise coefficient of NC 35 and a reverberation time of 0.6 seconds are the maximum allowable (worst-case) acoustics parameters for some spaces, whereas a noise coefficient of NC 25 is desirable and NC 30 is the maximum permitted for other spaces. Wherever video broadcasting will occur, the background colors shall be neutral, such as beige, light gray, or light blue.
4.2 Furniture
4.2.1 INSTRUCTOR'S PODIUM
4.2.1.1 CODE/REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
Section 802.1 in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design addresses the requirements for wheelchair-accessible spaces. In order to meet this requirement, adjustable-height podiums are required, and they must be open beneath the work surface to permit a wheelchair to roll underneath. However, since the A/V Equipment Rack and other equipment are mounted inside the podium beneath the work surface, there is not space for a wheelchair to roll underneath. Exception Advisory 226.1 of the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design explains that ADA requirements do not apply to work surfaces for employees. Accommodations for employee work surfaces are allowable on an "as needed" basis.

FURNITURE
4.2.1.2 DESIGN GUIDELINES
The Instructor's podium shall be custom-designed by the Architect. On the back side of the podium (facing the classroom) the podium shall have a hinged door to allow access to the A/V equipment mounted inside the cabinet portion of the podium.
The space surrounding the podium shall comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.
WSUP will accommodate wheelchair-bound instructors by specifying a work surface on the side of each podium, sized 30" wide (minimum) at a height of 34". Preferably this work surface would fold out from a hinged attachment on the podium, but it could also be a table beside the podium. The control system used to operate the audio/visual equipment and other instructional technology shall be reachable by a person working from the fold-out work surface.
WSUP may wish to install a cable access cubby in the tops of some podiums. The Designer shall coordinate with the AVPM, the Telecommunications Designer, and the Electrical Engineer to cooperatively specify appropriate quantities of modular device inserts for power outlets, data cables, and audio/visual inputs for each application.
· WSUP currently uses products from Kramer and AMX for this purpose.
The Designer shall coordinate with WSUP FS Interior Designers to specify the podium stain color and desktop surface materials for a given project.
See Appendix 8.1 for example drawings of podium furniture, features, and space arrangement.
4.2.2 BUILT-IN CASEWORK
Built-in dual-door casework is used to host A/V equipment in some spaces (such as conference rooms). The casework shall be floorless, with no cabinet face structure behind the door, allowing an A/V equipment rack to roll out of the casework for service.
The internal clear dimensions shall be 34" high, 30" to 36" wide and 30" deep.
The casework must provide adequate ventilation to prevent overheating of the equipment inside. The following two features shall be provided for air circulation:
· A louvered vent on top of the casework door ­ 12" x 2".
· A 1" gap between the bottom of the casework door and the floor.
An open-faced junction box (18" high x 14" wide x 4" deep) shall be recessed into the wall behind the casework to terminate pathways and/or cabling serving A/V applications.
See Appendix 8.1.2, Conference Room Casework for example drawings of casework for A/V applications.
4.2.3 MOVABLE DEMONSTRATION TABLES
Movable demonstration tables shall be sized for the application, with locking casters so that the table can be easily moved when not required for a recording session.

EQUIPMENT RACKS AND CABINETS
4.2.4 CONFERENCE TABLES
Conference tables shall be designed by the Architect to meet the needs of the room. The table shall be designed to support cable routing from a floor box to a cable cubby via a table leg. The floor box location(s) shall be correlated with the cable routing leg, which ideally shall fully conceal the floor box. WSUP requires that a cable access cubby be installed in the top of each conference table. The Designer shall coordinate with the Telecommunications Designer and the Electrical Engineer to cooperatively specify appropriate quantities of modular device inserts for power outlets, data cables, and audio/visual inputs for each application.
· Tables 15' long or shorter require one cubby in the center of the table. · Tables longer than 15' require two cubbies, one each at the one-third points
along the length of the table. · WSUP currently uses products from Kramer and AMX for this purpose. When selecting the conference table, consider how cables for wired network, desktop microphones, A/V inputs, and wiring for power shall be routed from the floor box up through a table leg. It is recommended that tables be manufactured with integrated cable raceways and pop-up devices that provide tabletop access to electrical power, A/V features, and the network.
4.3 Equipment Racks and Cabinets
WSUP prefers racks and cabinets from Lowell or Middle-Atlantic.
4.3.1 GROUNDING / BONDING
All racks and cabinets shall be bonded to building ground (not isolated).
4.3.2 FIXED RACKS IN PODIUMS
One or two small fixed racks (14 rack units) shall be mounted inside instructor podiums. Sliding rails are not used, because the podium shall have a rear access door(s) as described above. WSUP prefers to use the Lowell LXR-1421, which provides 14-16 units of rack space.
4.3.3 RACKS IN CASEWORK
A mid-height rack (10 rack units minimum) shall be used to host equipment stored inside built-in casework for applications such as conference rooms. For this application, WSUP prefers to use either:
· Lowell LDTR-1018 · Middle Atlantic CFR-10-18

PATHWAYS
4.3.4 EQUIPMENT CABINETS
A 6-foot tall cabinet or two-post open rack ("relay rack") shall be used to host larger quantities of equipment in dedicated A/V spaces and applications such as A/V Equipment Rooms. The cabinets shall be bolted to the floor. Full-height cabinets shall have full-height, vertically-mounted PDU strips on rear of the rack and shall have a rack-mounted UPS, both Owner-provided.
4.4 Pathways
It is essential to the long-term cost-effective operation of each building that the infrastructure be in place to support the technology of the future. It is much less expensive to install physical infrastructure during construction than to retrofit spaces while the building is in use. Pathways and boxes shall be designed to serve the life of the building, not just day-one applications.
4.4.1 WIRE BASKET CABLE TRAY
A wire basket cable tray may be designed above the ceiling to distribute audio/visual cabling within the room. This tray shall connect to the main low-voltage distribution cable tray in the building.
· A 6" wide, 2" high tray is typically sufficient for most in-room A/V applications.
4.4.2 BOXES AND CONDUITS
A large junction box shall be provided above the ceiling (near the A/V Equipment Rack). The box shall be sized 12" x 12" x 6" (minimum dimensions), shall have a screw-cover, and shall be accessible in the ceiling space to work with cabling and to add future conduits. Device boxes/outlet boxes serving A/V applications shall comply with WSUP's telecommunications standards. Box sizing shall be as follows:
· Typically 4" square, 2 1/8" deep (minimum depth). With the mud-ring/extension ring, the overall internal depth shall be 2 ½" minimum.
· Where thick/stiff cabling is terminated (having large bend radius requirements), device boxes shall be 5" square boxes. See RANDL Industries, Inc. www.randlinc.com
· For wall-mounted devices (such as speakers and assistive listening transmitters), provide a single gang faceplate with a ½" grommeted hole for cable passthrough.

Conduits serving A/V applications shall comply with WSUP's telecommunications standards (see TDDG). In addition, the following requirements apply:
· All conduits shall be 1" trade size minimum.

PATHWAYS
· Conduits intended to pass large connectors shall be sized accordingly ­ typically 1½" trade size or larger (depending on cable fill and the sizes of factoryterminated connectors).
· Provide a separate conduit for speaker wiring.
4.4.3 A/V JUNCTION PANEL
The A/V Junction Panel is a coverless junction box that shall be recess-mounted into the wall in the back of the built-in casework serving A/V cabinets. The A/V Junction Panel shall be sized 18"W x 14"H x 4"D. Conduits from the A/V Junction Panel shall route to the following locations:
· A/V equipment locations · A/V floor box · Above ceiling A/V junction box · Above ceiling wire basket cable tray (if applicable).
4.4.4 A/V FLOOR BOXES
Large "oversize" floor boxes are required to accommodate the quantity of A/V cables, data cables, and power outlets that comprise A/V systems. Many A/V cables have limited bend radius due to the size and stiffness of the cables. An example of a large floor box solution uses the following products from Spider Agile Technology (www.spideragiletechnology.com):
· Rough-in "Pour Box": AFB-701 · Floor Box Insert: AFB-704 · Floor Box Insert: AFB-706

A/V Features, Functions & Services
GENERAL
5 A/V Features, Functions & Services
This section defines and describes the features, systems, materials, equipment, furnishings, and services that shall be used in audio/visual systems for WSUP. The Designer shall design these into the various application spaces (classrooms, conference rooms, etc.) in WSUP facilities as described in Section 6. The Designer shall incorporate this content into the construction drawings and specifications.
WSUP prefers to consistently use the same equipment from project to project wherever possible to optimize spare parts management. When a component fails, it is very desirable to replace it with an identical make and model so that the control logic programmed into the system will work with the replacement device. The manufacturers and equipment models for equipment currently used at WSUP are referenced below in each category. The Designer shall:
· Verify that this equipment will be available at the time the building is constructed.
· If this equipment will not be available, work cooperatively with the WSUP AVPM to select a replacement, preferably from the same manufacturer and product family as the listed equipment.
· Design the systems using this equipment or the WSUP-approved equivalent.
5.1 General
Generally speaking, audio/visual systems are comprised of devices and functions in three categories:
· Sourcing and Input
· Distribution and Routing
· Output Also, audio/visual equipment can serve audio, video, and "other" functions.
The following diagram depicts the various types of devices that generally comprise WSUP's audio/visual systems:
