PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1 A.
1.2

SUMMARY
Provide all materials and labor for the installation of a grounding and bonding system for outside plant telecommunications infrastructure. This section includes requirements for providing a permanent grounding and bonding infrastructure for communications ductbanks, maintenance holes, handholes, and splice closures. These requirements are in addition to any that may exist in Division 26 and Division 27.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Review and edit the following statement(s) for applicability to this project, restricted to describing performance, design requirements and functional tolerances of a complete system.

A.
B. 1.3
A.

Furnish, install, and place into satisfactory and successful operation all materials, devices, and necessary appurtenances to provide a complete, permanent Grounding and Bonding infrastructure for outside plant telecommunications circuits, termination hardware, raceways, and spaces as hereinafter specified and/or shown on the Contract Documents. The Grounding and Bonding system shall support an ANSI/TIA/EIA and lSO/IEC compliant outside plant communications cabling system as specified in section 33 82 00 ­ "Communications Distribution."
The work shall include materials, equipment and apparatus not specifically mentioned herein or noted on the plans but which are necessary to make a complete working ANSI/TIA/EIA and ISO/IEC compliant Grounding and Bonding system.
DEFINITIONS
"OSP-SCS" shall mean Outside Plant - Structured Cabling System. The OSP-SCS is defined as all required equipment and materials including, but not limited to, ANSI/TIA/EIA and ISO/IEC compliant copper and fiber optic cable (multimode and singlemode), connectors, splices, splice closures and other

incidental and miscellaneous equipment and materials as required for a fully operational, tested, certified, and warranted system, compliant with all applicable codes and standards.

B. "MH" shall mean Maintenance Holes used for the routing of outside plant communications cables.
C. "HH" shall mean Handholes used for the routing of outside plant communications cables.
D. "TMGB" shall mean Telecommunications Main Grounding Busbar. There is typically one TMGB per building, located in the main telecommunications room. This busbar is directly bonded to the electrical service ground.

E. "TGB" shall mean Telecommunications Grounding Busbar. There is typically one TGB per telecommunications room. The TGB is connected both to the TMGB and to building structural steel or other permanent metallic systems.

F. "TBB" shall mean Telecommunications Bonding Backbone. The TBB is a conductor used to connect TMGBs to TGBs. Review and edit the following list of definitions for applicability to this project. Add and/or remove definitions for unusual terms that are not explained in the conditions of the Contract and that are used in ways not common to standard references.
NOTE: Furnish, provide and install are used repeatedly throughout this specification. The Designer shall ensure that these terms are identified in the appropriate section of the project manual. The definitions of these terms shall be similar to the following:
Furnish - "Supply and deliver to the project site, ready for unloading, unpacking, assembly, installation and similar operations".
Install - "Operations at the project site including unloading, unpacking, assembly, erection, placing, anchoring, applying, working to dimension, finishing, curing, protecting, cleaning and similar operations".
Provide - "To furnish and install, complete and ready for the intended operation".

G. "OSPBB" shall mean Outside Plant Bonding Backbone. The OSPBB is a conductor used to connect the grounding and bonding hardware in maintenance holes and hand holes, and also to the TMGB.

PART 2 - PRODUCTS Ensure that products listed under the PART 2 ­ Products paragraphs have corresponding installation instructions in PART 3 ­ Execution, or in another specification section if furnished but not installed under this section.
WSUP has standardized on certain manufacturers and certain products for all new Structured Cabling Systems in WSUP facilities. Products shall be specified accordingly. The Designer shall ensure that the latest part numbers are used for specified products. Any substitutions require WSUP pre-approval before specification.
If the Designer wishes to use products that deviate from WSUP standards, a Standards Variance Request shall be made, as described in the Technology Infrastructure Design Guide (TIDG). If the alternative product is approved, the Designer shall adapt this to reflect the approved changes.
