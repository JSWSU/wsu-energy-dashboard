DESIGN CRITERIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SPACES

D. At least two power outlets shall be provided (each with dedicated circuits) for exclusive use by telecommunications-related electronic equipment.
· Outlets shall be colored orange, labeled as "Technical Power" and shall show the panel and circuit numbers.
· Where 110VAC Technical power outlets are required, outlets shall be equipped for "straight-blade plugs" (NEMA 5-20R), rather than twist-lock style receptacles.
· Where 208VAC or 240VAC technical power outlets are required, the Designer shall inquire with the WSUP ITPM to determine the plug requirements for the equipment to be served.
· Each outlet shall be equipped with a dedicated insulated solid copper equipment-grounding conductor. Ground conductors serving technical power outlets shall not be isolated ground conductors.
· See the telecommunications room plan details in Appendix 6.1 of the TDDG for technical power outlet locations.
E. The Designer shall specifically investigate the potential need for voltage or Ampere requirements other than the typical 110VAC/20 Ampere power outlet. Some UPS and network switch equipment requires specialized plugs or electrical service. The Designer shall inquire with the WSUP ITPM to determine whether any dedicated or specialized circuit requirements exist.
4.3.6.4.1 NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECTS
A. Faceplates for power receptacles and light switches in the TR shall be mounted at the surface of the plywood backboard (as opposed to being recessed into a cutout in the plywood backboard). The device boxes shall be recessed into the wall (not surface-mounted).
4.3.6.4.1.1 Telecommunications Rooms with 1 or 2 Floor-Standing Racks
A. One duplex technical power outlet per floor-standing rack shall be provided to serve each rack. The outlet(s) shall be mounted on the side wall nearest the racks, approximately 18 inches behind the rack. Technical power outlets shall be mounted at the standard mounting height above the finished floor.
B. The rack nearest the wall is expected to host a rack-mounted UPS at the base of the rack. The UPS will plug into the duplex power outlet, and the network equipment will plug into the UPS.
C. Electronic equipment in the second rack is typically powered by UPS in the first rack. However, if necessary, another UPS can be installed in the base of the second rack, and the power cord can be routed beneath the first UPS to the second rack-dedicated technical power outlet.
D. Typically, WSUP furnishes and installs the UPS equipment.
E. For racks where WSUP intends to install equipment with dual-redundant power supplies, two duplex technical power outlets with separate circuits shall be provided for those racks. The Designer shall inquire with WSUP whether equipment with dual power supplies will be used.

DESIGN CRITERIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SPACES

4.3.6.4.1.2 Telecommunications Rooms with More than 2 Floor-Standing Racks
A. The first two racks are served as described above.
B. A dedicated duplex technical power outlet (pedestal style) shall be floor-mounted near the vertical cable management of each additional rack.
C. Conduit for each pedestal outlet shall be concealed in the floor where possible. Otherwise, the conduit shall be routed exposed from the wall to the pedestal, above the base-plates of the first and second racks. The bottom rack spaces (reserved for UPS equipment) shall not be obstructed by the power conduit.
4.3.6.4.1.3 Other Technical Power Outlets
A. In addition to the outlets intended to serve the racks, a minimum of one duplex technical power outlet shall be provided per wall (centered on the wall) except for the wall adjacent to the racks.
B. For walls more than 10' in length, a minimum of 2 outlets shall be provided, and at intervals of no more than 6 feet between outlets.
4.3.6.4.2 MINOR REMODEL PROJECTS
A. The design shall include technical power outlets according to the "new construction" requirements, wherever possible. However, for some projects it may not be realistic or practical to meet those requirements. The following two paragraphs describe an alternative arrangement of technical power outlets that may be approved on a project-by-project basis via the SVR process:
· If it is not practical to install a new power outlet at the base of each equipment rack, it may be acceptable to serve the rack's power needs from a wallmounted outlet.
· If power outlets are not installed at the base of each rack, the number of wallmounted technical power outlets shall be increased to an interval of one outlet every 6 feet. Power outlets in this arrangement shall be located such that they are conveniently aligned with the equipment racks to avoid inadvertent disconnection of the power cords.
B. Where telecommunications backboards are applied to existing walls with existing power outlets and light switches, the design shall require backboards to be provided with cutouts permitting access to the existing electrical devices.
4.3.6.5 ADDITIONAL CONVENIENCE POWER OUTLETS
A. In addition to the technical power outlets described above, the design shall require the Contractor to provide other duplex convenience outlets (120VAC, 15 Ampere) that would be available for use with power tools and testing equipment. Each outlet shall be labeled with its panel identification and circuit number.
B. Where telecommunications cabinets are used in lieu of a TR, there shall be at least one general-purpose convenience power outlet (120VAC, 15 Ampere)

DESIGN CRITERIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SPACES
located within six feet of each telecommunications cabinet. This outlet shall be colored consistently with other convenience outlets in the building. The generalpurpose outlet shall not be used to power telecommunications equipment associated with the cabinet.
· For minor remodel projects, the number of convenience outlets in a TR can be reduced.
C. Convenience power outlets can be circuited to the technical power panel.
4.3.7 GROUNDING, BONDING, AND ELECTRICAL PROTECTION
All equipment racks, metallic conduits, and exposed non-current-carrying metal parts of telecommunications and information technology equipment in the TR shall be bonded to the TMGB. Refer to Chapter 9 Bonding and Grounding in the BICSI TDMM and TDDG Section 4.8 for more information regarding the design of grounding, bonding and electrical protection systems.
A. Grounding and bonding conductors shall be sized according to the requirements in ANSI/TIA/EIA J-STD-607A.
B. The Designer shall design the ground conductor sizing appropriately for the application, with a minimum size of 2 AWG.
4.3.8 CABLES ENTERING TELECOMMUNICATIONS ROOMS
All cables shall be fully supported and properly transitioned throughout the length of the cables, including proper bend radius fittings at pathway transitions. Where cabling is routed vertically, it shall be appropriately secured such that the weight of the cabling does not subject the cabling to stresses that could potentially reduce the performance of the cabling.
4.3.9 ENTRANCE FACILITIES
4.3.9.1 OUTSIDE PLANT CONDUIT ENTRANCE
All WSUP utility services are delivered to the main demark on campus. Therefore, the concept of an Entrance Facility at WSUP buildings is limited to entrance conduits from the outside plant into the main telecommunications room in the building. Typically, WSUP prefers to co-locate the entrance facility with the main telecommunications room.
4.3.9.2 ROOFTOP CONDUIT ENTRANCE
The Designer shall inquire with the FSPM to determine whether the building will require any rooftop communications applications. If required, appropriately sized conduit pathway shall be designed between the roof and the topmost telecommunications room in the building. The conduits shall be terminated above the roof with a weatherhead.

WSU Pullman Campus ­ Telecommunications Distribution Design Guide

June 24, 2015

DESIGN CRITERIA
BACKBONE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS

Rooftop conduits can be used to serve antennae for service inputs (satellite, emergency responder radio, cellular service) to provide pathway for cabling serving cameras or other devices mounted on the roof.

4.3.9.3 NON-WSUP TENANT DEMARC
The Designer shall inquire with the FSPM whether any non-WSUP tenants will occupy space in the building. In such cases, those tenants will probably need utility services delivered directly to the building.
Third parties shall not have unattended access to WSUP telecommunications spaces. WSUP ITS staff are not typically available to escort third parties and their utility representatives while they work on their communications infrastructure.
Therefore, a separate space shall be allocated in or near the main telecommunications room of the building for limited utility demarc applications, in a location near the entrance conduits. The service demarc for the non-WSUP tenants shall be separately segregated outside the space where WSUP cabling terminates and WSUP network equipment resides.
The Designer shall inquire with the ITPM which of the following acceptable methods shall be used to separate non-WSUP tenant service equipment from WSUP equipment and cable termination locations:
· Chainlink fencing with a locking gate dividing the telecommunications room. · Anteroom/Vestibule with locking door between Anteroom and WSUP
telecommunications room. · Completely separate room.

4.4 Backbone Distribution Systems
Please refer to Chapter 4, Backbone Distribution Systems in the BICSI TDMM, Chapter 5, Cabling Infrastructure, and Chapter 6, Pathways and Spaces in the BICSI OSPDRM, and Chapter 2, Pathways and Spaces in the BICSI ITSIMM for general information regarding the design of backbone distribution pathway and cabling. The following requirements take precedence over the guidelines in those documents for telecommunications infrastructure at WSUP facilities:

4.4.1 INTRA-BUILDING BACKBONE PATHWAYS

A. Intra-building backbone pathway shall utilize a physical star topology. The Designer, however, shall inquire whether another pathway topology would be appropriate for a given application. Backbone raceway shall consist of conduit, chases or shafts, sleeves, and/or vertically-mounted ladder racking.

B. All cables shall be fully supported and properly transitioned throughout the length of the cables, including proper bend radius fittings at pathway transitions. Where cabling is routed vertically, it shall be appropriately secured such that the weight of the cabling does not subject the cabling to stresses that could potentially reduce the performance of the cabling.

DESIGN CRITERIA
BACKBONE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS

C. In new construction and remodel projects:

1. The main telecommunications room in the building shall have a direct pathway connection to the entrance facility.

2. All intermediate telecommunications rooms shall have direct pathway connections to the main telecommunications room in the building.

·

This is usually accomplished with vertical riser pathway (STI EzPath).

3. For buildings requiring multiple intermediate telecommunications rooms on a given floor, the secondary telecommunications rooms do not require a direct backbone pathway to the main telecommunications room. Instead, the first intermediate telecommunications room on a floor shall have a direct pathway and the other telecommunications rooms shall connect to the first via the main cable tray on that floor.

·

This solution is typically adequate when backbone cables are

relatively small compared to the horizontal cable load in the cable

tray.

·

Even though pathway from one telecommunications room may

connect to another telecommunications room before connecting to the

main telecommunications room, backbone cabling shall not cross-
