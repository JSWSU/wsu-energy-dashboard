Construction Document Content
PROJECT MANUAL
B. The Project Manual shall contain a summary of the audio/visual work on the project, a description of the demolition requirements (if applicable), and a discussion of the utility coordination requirements.
C. In addition to these requirements, the Project Manual shall contain the A/V Systems Cutover Plan.
7.2.1 SPECIFICATIONS
7.2.1.1 WSUP AUDIO/VISUAL CONSTRUCTION GUIDE SPECIFICATION
A. The WSUP Audio/Visual Construction Guide Specification (AVCGS) is a guide specification as opposed to a master specification. It does not include an exhaustive listing of all possible products or installation methods that could be employed in an audio/visual project.
B. The AVCGS is an example of a specification that shall be used for an A/V upgrade project or for a new facility project. It has verbiage that identifies issues that the Designer shall consider throughout the adaptation process. The Designer shall adapt the sections in the AVCGS to the particular requirements of the given project.
C. The Designer shall directly edit the AVCGS for use on each project. The Designer shall notify the WSUP AVPM where changes or additions to the specifications are desired. Edits to the documents shall be performed with the "Revision Tracking" features activated. At the various project milestones when the documents are submitted to WSUP for review, the specifications shall be printed showing the revision markings.
D. The Designer shall be responsible for adding any necessary content to the specification that is applicable to the project and not already contained in the AVCGS.
E. Please refer to the more detailed instructions contained in the AVCGS, both in the Preface of that document as well as in the "hidden text" comments contained in the electronic files.
7.2.1.2 COMMON SPECIFICATION SECTIONS
There are several specification sections that are commonly used for audio/visual systems or contain content that supports audio/visual functionality. The following section is a WSUP standard and addresses Instructor Podiums. The Architect and Audio/Visual Designer will have involvement in the preparation of this section:
· 06 41 23 ­ Interior Custom Casework

Sections typically provided by the Audio/Visual Designer: · 27 41 00 ­ Audio/Video Systems
7.2.2 CUTOVER PLAN
The Designer shall provide a detailed cutover plan that is coordinated with other disciplines on the project as well as with WSUP data and telephone equipment cutover requirements. Verbiage describing the sequence of work tasks to accomplish the cutover shall be provided in this section. Limitations on the permissible downtime allowed and temporary service arrangements shall be discussed in the cutover plans.
Not all projects will require a cutover plan.
7.2.3 FIBER LINK-LOSS BUDGET ANALYSIS
For projects that include fiber optic cabling as part of the audio/visual system:
A. The Designer shall provide (in the Construction Documents) a link-loss budget analysis for each fiber optic cable.
B. The link-loss budget analysis shall be formatted as shown in the Appendix of WSUP's Telecommunications Distribution Design Guide. Upon request, WSUP will provide an electronic spreadsheet file to be used as a template.

RECORD DRAWINGS AND DOCUMENTATION
7.3 Record Drawings and Documentation
The Instructions for Architects and Engineers Doing Business with Division of Engineering and Architectural Services (published by the Washington State Department of General Administration) lists requirements for Record Drawings and submittals. The following requirements related to Record Drawings and submittals are in addition to the requirements listed in Instructions for Architects and Engineers Doing Business with Division of Engineering and Architectural Services:
7.3.1 RECORD DRAWING CONTENT
· The Record Drawings shall show the identifiers for the audio/visual equipment and cabling as constructed.
7.3.2 RECORD DRAWING DELIVERABLES
The following shall be delivered to the WSUP FSPM, the second copy of which shall be given to the AVPM:
· Two copies of a CDROM containing editable 2D AutoCAD drawings (with all xrefs bound to the drawing) of the audio/visual plans, elevations, and details, in addition to the Revit or BIM model files.
· Two copies of the A/V subcontractor's redline drawings and updated CAD drawings (reflecting construction adjustments), in both printed and electronic form (on CDROM).
· Two copies of a CDROM containing the digital photographs taken by the Designer during the project shall be delivered to WSUP Facilities Planning and Construction.
