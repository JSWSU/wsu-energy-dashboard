CABLE

A. General (applicable to all cable types): Provide non-plenum (CM/CMR, OFNR) rated cable for locations where cable is to be installed in conduit. For cable not installed in conduit, provide plenum (CMP, OFNP) rated cable if cable is installed in a plenum air space environment. Otherwise, provide nonplenum-rated (CMR) cabling. Cabling shall bear plenum or non-plenum markings for the environment in which it is installed. 1. Horizontal Distribution: Provide station cable in types, sizes, and quantities as defined by the Symbol Schedule and as shown on the Contract Documents. Install cable between the station and its associated telecommunications room. Provide one cable per each connector at each station. Provide cables of the same type in the same color ­ multiple colors of the same cable type are not acceptable. 2. Install cable in compliance with ANSI/TIA/EIA and ISO/IEC 11801 requirements and BICSI TCIM practices. 3. Adhere to the bending radius and pull strength requirements as detailed in the ANSI/TIA/EIA standards and the manufacturer's installation recommendations during cable handling and installation. a. Pull all cables simultaneously where more than one cable is being installed in the same raceway. b. Use pulling compound or lubricant where necessary. Use compounds that will not damage conductor or insulation (Polywater, or approved equal). c. Use pulling means, including fish tape, cable, rope, and basket-weave wire/cable grips that will not damage media or raceway. Repair or replace conduit bushings that become damaged during cabling installation. 4. Install cable in a continuous (non-spliced) manner unless otherwise indicated. 5. Install exposed cable parallel to and perpendicular to surfaces on exposed structural members and follow surface contours where possible. 6. Tie or clamp cabling. Attaching cables to pipes, electrical conduit, mechanical items, existing cables, or the ceiling support system (grids, hanger wires, etc. ­ with the exception of ceiling support anchors) is not acceptable. Install tie-wraps in conformance with the GPON manufacturer's installation recommendations. Do not over-tighten tie wraps or cause crosssectional deformation of cabling. 7. Cable at the backboards: a. Lay and dress cables to allow other cables to enter raceway (conduit or otherwise) without difficulty at a later time by maintaining a working distance from these openings. b. Route cable as close as possible to the ceiling, floor, sides, or corners to insure that adequate wall or backboard space is available for current and future equipment and for cable terminations. c. Do not use D-rings to route horizontal GPON cabling. Instead, use vertical ladder racking (securing cabling with hook-and-loop straps) and horizontal ladder racking, using the most direct route to the termination point. Route via a path that will minimize obstruction to future installation of equipment, backboards or other cables. 8. Cable in the telecommunications rooms: a. For telecommunications rooms with ladder racking, lay cable neatly in ladder rack in even bundles and loosely secure cabling to the ladder rack at regular intervals with hook-andloop straps. 9. Cable terminating on patch panels located on racks: a. Route cables in telecommunications rooms to patch panels on racks by routing across ladder rack across top of rack and then down vertical ladder rack to patch panel.

B. Fiber Optic Cable: 1. Provide station cable in the locations shown on the Contract Documents. Provide service loops with a minimum length of 12 inches in outlet boxes and no less than 10 feet in the ER/TR's.

Store the remainder of the slack using manufacturer-recommended solutions (reels, cartridges, etc.). a. For workstation outlets with both fiber and copper cabling, terminate fiber optic cabling
after copper cabling has been installed and terminated.
Commscope manufactures a multimode zipcord product that is indoor/outdoor rated, and plenum rated. However, they don't currently manufacture this cable in singlemode. With the pending merger between Commscope and TE expected to culminate in 2015, it is anticipated that a singlemode product can be procured within TE's warranty coverage at some point in the near future.

Delete the following paragraph if there are no wet area applications in the project.
b. For fiber optic station cabling installed in wet areas, including floor boxes in slab-on-grade applications, use Indoor/Outdoor Wet Environment-rated cabling.
2. Innerduct
The Designer shall indicate in the Contract Documents where innerduct is required, consistent with the requirements described below.
a. Innerduct is required for routing horizontal GPON fiber optic cabling through all vertical riser pathways (conduits and sleeves) that exceed 4 feet in length.
b. Innerduct is also required for routing horizontal GPON fiber optic cabling through cable trays where larger outside plant cable shares the cable tray.
c. Otherwise, innerduct is not required for routing horizontal GPON fiber optic cabling. d. Where innerduct is required, install fiber optic cable in innerduct per manufacturer's
instructions. Innerduct shall terminate within 6 inches of top of each patch panel where fiber optic cable terminates. Secure innerduct with zip-ties at intervals not exceeding 24 inches. Do not use wire or tape. e. See Sections 27 13 00 and 33 82 00 for innerduct requirements related to fiber optic backbone cabling in inside plant and outside plant backbone applications, respectively.
The Designer shall verify during construction that this form has been submitted by the Contractor.

3.9

LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION

A. Horizontal Cable Labeling: 1. Provide white-colored labels. 2. Cables at Patch Panel end: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the patch panel termination point (on the rear of the patch panel). Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping applied over the label in order to permanently affix the label to the cable. Using transparent tape to affix labels to cables is not acceptable. b. Affix a second label on the front side of the patch panel adjacent to the screen-printed jack number where the cable terminates. c. Cables shall be labeled according to the following scheme:
aaaaa
aaaaa = Room Number where outlet is located
3. Cables at Outlet end: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the jack. Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping applied over the label in order to permanently affix the label to the cable. Using transparent tape to affix labels to cables is not acceptable. b. Affix a second label on the exterior of the faceplate, adjacent to the jack corresponding to the cable.

c. Labeling shall be according to the following scheme:

aaaaa:bcdd

or

aaaaa:

bcdd

aaaaa = Telecom Room Number where patch panel is located b = Equipment Rack Number c = Patch Panel Number dd = Patch Panel Port Number

4. Apply the cable numbering shown in the horizontal cable labeling scheme found in the Appendix at the end of this specification section. For cable numbering that is not shown on the drawings, request numbering assignments from the Owner.
5. For outlets that are mounted above an accessible ceiling (such as for wireless access points), affix white adhesive label to the underside of the ceiling grid beneath the outlet such that the label is visible to a person walking through the room. The label's location shall allow a person to know which ceiling tile to remove to access the outlet.

B.
3.10 A.

Labeling on Patch Panels: 1. General: Label patch panels as shown on the Contract Documents. 2. Provide white-colored labels. 3. Ports: Ports are typically pre-labeled by the manufacturer with adapter pack numbering and
sequential jack numbers (i.e. 1 to 12). Provide a label for each port that matches the label of the cable terminated on that port. Do not cover the manufacturer's port numbering with the labels.
TESTING
Provide test records on a form approved by the Owner and Designer. Include the test results for each cable in the system. Submit the test results for each cable tested with identification as discussed under LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION above. Include the cable identifier, outcome of test, indication of errors found, cable length, retest results, and name and signature of technician completing the tests. Provide test results to the Owner and Designer for review and acceptance within two weeks of Substantial Completion. 1. Print test records for each cable within the system directly from the tester to an Adobe Acrobat
PDF file, and submit only in electronic form (on CDROM or DVDROM) to the Owner and Designer for review. Handwritten test results will not be accepted.

B. Test the GPON after installation for compliance to all applicable standards as follows: 1. Fiber Optic: a. Horizontal Distribution: Test all strands following the procedure in Section 27 13 00 ­ "Communications Backbone Cabling".

C. Identify cables and equipment that do not pass to the Owner and Designer. Determine the source of the non-compliance and replace or correct the cable or the connection materials. Retest the cable or connection materials at no additional expense to the Owner. Provide a complete revised set of all test results to the Owner and Designer, in the same manner as above. Remove original individual cable test reports that are unacceptable and insert the new corrected cable test reports. Do not simply resubmit the test reports for the corrected cabling only. 1. In addition to the above, if it is determined that the cable is faulty, remove the damaged cable and replace it with a new cable. Cable repairs are not acceptable. The procedure for removing the cable shall be as follows: a. Prior to removal of damaged cable and installation of new cable: 1) Inform the Owner and Designer of the schedule for the removal and installation. 2) Test the new cable on the reel per paragraph B, above.

3) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether or not they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project.
b. Remove the damaged cable and provide new cable. c. After the removal of the damaged cable and installation of the new cable:
1) Test the new cable per the paragraph titled TESTING. 2) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the
damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project. a) If any of the cables requiring testing are in use, coordinate with the Owner to
schedule an outage opportunity during which the testing can be performed. d. If a cable which occupies the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as a damaged
cable is damaged by the extraction and installation process, replace the cable at no additional expense to the Owner. 1) Damaged cables which are replaced shall be subject to the testing procedures of the
paragraph titled TESTING.

Designer ­ add a cable labeling schedule to this section for horizontal copper and horizontal fiber, similar to the example provided.
Change the red-colored "X" to indicate the number of pages.
