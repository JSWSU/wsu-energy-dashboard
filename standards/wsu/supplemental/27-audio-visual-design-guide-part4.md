5.2 Sourcing and Input Devices
The audio/visual system shall support audio and video content from the following sources and input devices:

5.2.1 MICROPHONES

5.2.1.1 CEILING-HUNG
Ceiling-hung microphones shall be digital, three-element devices from Polycom. They shall be installed according to the manufacturer's specifications in sufficient quantity and necessary spacing to adequately cover the entire classroom seating and teaching area.
Ceiling-hung microphones shall be supported using wire to building structure. Coordinate with the installer of the ceiling grid to shoot-in extra ceiling wires to support microphones, speakers, and electronics boxes for microphones.
The Polycom microphones WSUP currently uses cover a 15-foot radius area. Fieldconstructed cables for the Polycom microphones must be fabricated using STP CAT5e cable. Pay close attention to the manufacturer's instructions for cable pinout, which does not follow T568A or T568B rollover standards.
WSUP also uses a ceiling-box mounted Crown PZM-11 pressure zone microphone for some applications.

5.2.1.2 DESK-MOUNTED
The Designer shall inquire whether desktop devices are required, and if so, which of the following two options should be used for a given project:
· Option 1:
Ceiling-hung microphones may be used. In these cases, the system shall be programmed to activate or mute the corresponding ceiling microphones with a desktop control interface.
· Option 2:
Desktop microphones shall be Shure 392C. The system shall be programmed to activate or mute the microphone as the button is pressed.
Any desktop microphone use will require the consideration of wireless options and preapproval of the WSUP AVPM on a case-by-case basis.

5.2.1.3 WIRELESS
Wireless microphones require the use of a receiver/transmitter in each application space. The receiver shall be located in a position near the control equipment of the other audio/visual systems. All wireless microphones shall be UHF, tunable, with the ability to self-determine available radio frequencies. All microphone installations shall be

done in accordance with good engineering practices and with coordination of frequencies with nearby users.
The microphone shall be wired into the sound system to allow for voice reinforcement to the room without feedback. Volume adjustment for the microphone shall be immediately available to the instructor.
WSUP currently uses Shure BLX4R with WL185 microphones.

5.2.2 CAMERAS

5.2.2.1 DOCUMENT CAMERAS
The document camera shall rest on the top of the instructor podium. It shall be connected to the video switcher/scaler to enable quick and easy change of sources. WSUP has currently standardized on the following document camera:
· Epson DC-20

5.2.2.2 CONFERENCE ROOM CAMERAS
WSUP currently uses the Polycom Eagle Eye series camera for conference room applications.

5.2.2.3 CLASSROOM CAMERAS
WSUP currently uses the Vaddio WallView series camera for GUC applications. The Designer shall discuss with the AVPM the cameras to be used.

5.2.3 BLU-RAY/DVD PLAYER
The Designer shall discuss Blu-ray/DVD player equipment with the AVPM.

5.2.4 OWNER-PROVIDED COMPUTER
Computers shall be provided by WSUP in accordance with established standards. WSUP currently provides a video panel. The Owner-provided computer will mount in the A/V Equipment Rack inside the Instructor Podium (either rack-mounted, or provide a 2U shelf). The monitor shall sit on top of the Instructor Podium, on the side of the podium that is away from the classroom door.
· The monitor shall be secured to the podium furniture with a suitable cable and lock assembly to impede theft.

5.2.5 PORTABLE DEVICES
Audio/visual systems shall be capable of receiving audio and video inputs from portable devices, including but not limited to notebook computers, tablet computers, and multimedia devices.

DISTRIBUTION AND ROUTING EQUIPMENT
WSUP currently requires HDMI audio/video, HD15 XGA video, 3.5mm audio inputs, a set of RCA audio and video inputs, an XLR input for a microphone, and three USB typeA connections. An Ethernet cable is also required for notebook computers. The Designer shall discuss with the AVPM whether DisplayPort will be required, in lieu of the HD15 connector. The Designer shall discuss the wireless collaboration solution with the AVPM.
5.3 Distribution and Routing Equipment
5.3.1 VIDEO SWITCHING EQUIPMENT
Video switching (and scaling) will be required to meet digital distribution needs. All inputs (analog and digital) shall be scaled to a single resolution best matching the native resolution of the display devices in the room. WSUP currently uses the Kramer or Sierra Video switching and routing product families.
5.3.2 AUDIO/VIDEO SWITCHING EQUIPMENT
Audio and video switching may be done with the Kramer ProScale series or AMX Enova series (which includes a small audio amplifier) if this is appropriate for the application. The Designer shall discuss this selection in advance with the AVPM.
5.3.3 AUDIO SIGNAL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT
Audio signal processing may be done with the Biamp Audia or Nexia series equipment.
5.3.4 AMPLIFIERS
The Designer shall discuss the audio requirements and options with the AVPM prior to starting the design. Audio systems shall be designed in such a manner as to provide (at every location within the classroom) a clearly intelligible instructor speech monaural audio signal. Audio levels front-to-back and side-to-side shall not vary by more than 2dB at any point within the seating area. Audio enhancement shall provide a level of not less than 55 dB SPL at 48 inches above finished floor in the classroom seating area. Amplifiers shall typically be Class D type, providing a minimum of 75W RMS per channel and supporting speakers of 4, 8 and 16 ohms. Amplifiers may have 70V line outputs intrinsic in their design.
· WSUP currently uses amplifier equipment from Crest/Peavey and AMX (Enova). Separate amplification of content audio (not speech) may be designed into the system.

5.3.5 VIDEO CONFERENCING ENDPOINTS
WSUP currently uses Polycom High Definition Group Series Video Conferencing Endpoint (VCE) equipment with Polycom's RealPresence platform. The VCE contains an integrated codec. VCEs connect to IT networks via a standard 100 Mbps Ethernet jack. Two video sources connect directly to the VCE inputs:
· Cameras · Content video Two audio sources connect directly to the VCE inputs via an Audio DSP/router/mixer from Biamp or Polycom: · Microphones · Content audio Input and output switching as well as volume are controlled via the room control system.
5.4 Output Devices
The audio/visual system shall output audio and video content to the following devices:
5.4.1 SPEAKERS
WSUP uses 70V, 4-ohm and 8-ohm audio speakers. Speaker quantity, arrangement, and spacing shall be designed sufficient to provide for an even coverage of the entire seating area with a volume level of not less than 15 dBA above the average ambient room sound.
5.4.1.1 CEILING-MOUNTED
Ceiling-mounted speakers shall be spaced appropriately for the broadcast pattern of the speaker specified.
Ceiling-hung speakers shall be supported using wires attached to the building structure or using suspension systems designed for use with T-bar ceiling materials.
WSUP typically uses speakers from QSC and Pure Resonance.
5.4.1.2 WALL-MOUNTED
Wall-mounted speakers are also used at WSUP where a room application has ceiling circumstances that are not practical for ceiling-mounted speakers. The device box serving the speakers shall have a faceplate with center hole for wire exit. The Designer shall discuss this situation in advance with the AVPM. WSUP typically uses speakers from QSC and Pure Resonance.
