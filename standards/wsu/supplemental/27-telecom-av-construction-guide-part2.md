1.10 COORDINATION

A. References to the "Owner" or "Owner's representative" throughout the Division 27 specification sections shall be interpreted to mean both the WSUP FSPM and the WSUP ITPM. All requirements to seek approval of the Owner require the involvement of the WSUP ITPM.

B. The Division 27 Contractor shall coordinate work with that of the other contractors doing work in the building and shall examine all drawings, including the several divisions of mechanical, ventilating, structural and general, for construction details and necessary coordination.

C. Coordinate and schedule connecting electrical systems with exterior underground and overhead utilities and services. Comply with requirements of governing regulations, franchised service companies, and controlling agencies.

D. Coordinate the interruption of electrical systems to any part of the facility in use by the Owner at least 48 hours before interruption of the system.
E. Special attention is called for the following items and all conflicts shall be reported to the Architect/Engineer before installation for decision or correction: 1. Location of fixtures, pipes, ducts and other mechanical equipment such that telecommunications and audio/visual outlets, wall-mounted telephone devices, equipment racks and panels and other electrical equipment are mounted in proper relationship to these items.

2. Location of cabinets and counters such that communications work is clear from and in proper relation to these items.
3. Penetrations of building structure for communications work. 4. Compliance to Section 110-26 of NEC. 5. Coordination and provisions for maintaining telephone service to areas in use during construction,
especially elevator equipment, fire alarm systems, security systems and emergency systems (comply with General Division Provisions). 6. Communications equipment shall fit in the space provided on the plan drawings or as specified. Equipment heights shall not exceed those shown or specified. Larger equipment shall not be considered acceptable. Contractor shall be responsible for all clearances around the communications equipment.
Telephone and Internet services required by the Contractor during construction shall be provided by the Contractor. The Owner does not provide any communications utility services for construction projects. At substantial completion, the Owner will assume responsibility for communications utility services to the building and will transfer services at that time. This includes (but is not limited to) the following: 1. Telephone and Internet service for the Jobsite Construction Trailers 2. Elevator telephone 3. HVAC system Internet or networking 4. Internet or networking for other building services.
When conduit, insert or sleeves for outlet boxes and/or conduits are required, Contractor shall fully coordinate the installation thereof with other trades.
Contractor shall coordinate the Division 27 work in other campus buildings that may be required to support the project, such as the Main Communications Facility (MCF), Intermediate Distribution Facilities (IDF), tunnels, vaults, enclosures, etc.
The communications contractor shall take full responsibility for furnishing, installing and troubleshooting all communications systems in the building. The communications contractor shall be responsible for overall coordination of all communications systems and ensuring correct and full operation of all systems and system interfaces. The communications contractor shall coordinate the interfaces between the communications systems and all other systems.
SEQUENCING Include any requirements for coordinating work with potentially unusual or specifically required sequencing. WSUP may choose to construct a project under two bid packages one for pathways and spaces (perhaps under a General Contract), and a second bid package for the Structured Cabling System (perhaps using the WA State DES Master Contract). The Designer must coordinate with WSUP to determine if two bid packages will be used and include verbiage in the appropriate specification sections requiring the contractors to coordinate construction phasing and schedules.

A. Provide coordination with the cabling manufacturers to ensure that manufacturers' inspectors are available to schedule site visits, inspections, and certification of the system. Provide and coordinate any manufacturer-required modifications and have manufacturer re-inspect and certify the system prior to the scheduled use of the system by the Owner.
B. The Contractor is solely responsible for all costs associated with scheduling the manufacturer inspection, the inspection itself and any manufacturer-required re-inspections, and for any modifications to the installation as required by the manufacturers.
