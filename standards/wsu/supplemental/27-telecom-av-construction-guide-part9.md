5. Install cable in a continuous (non-spliced) manner unless otherwise indicated. 6. Minimize the length of exposed (unjacketed) cable pairs, not to exceed ½ inch. 7. Install exposed cable parallel to and perpendicular to surfaces on exposed structural members
and follow surface contours where possible. 8. Tie or clamp cabling. Attaching cables to pipes, electrical conduit, mechanical items, existing
cables, or the ceiling support system (grids, hanger wires, etc. ­ with the exception of ceiling support anchors) is not acceptable. Cables shall not rest upon acoustic ceiling grids or panels. Install tie-wraps in conformance with the SCS manufacturer's installation recommendations. Do not over-tighten tie wraps or cause cross-sectional deformation of cabling. 9. Cabling in conduits: a. Where multiple conduits or sleeves are used to carry cabling, fill conduits completely (per
fill-ratio requirements) prior to using the next adjacent available conduit. Do not partially fill multiple conduits (and thereby waste space in a conduit) when it would be possible to completely fill that conduit. 10. Cabling in cable trays: a. Do not bundle cables together. b. During installation, temporarily install hook-and-loop straps (similar to Velcro) to hold cables in place near outside edges of cable tray around corners. After terminating the cables, remove the straps. 11. Cabling at backboards: a. Lay and dress cables to allow other cables to enter raceway (conduit or otherwise) without difficulty at a later time by maintaining a working distance from these openings. b. Route cable as close as possible to the ceiling, floor, sides, or corners to insure that adequate wall or backboard space is available for current and future equipment and for cable terminations. c. Do not use D-rings to route horizontal cabling. Instead, use vertical ladder racking (securing cabling with hook-and-loop straps) and horizontal ladder racking, using the most direct route to the termination point. Route via a path that will minimize obstruction to future installation of equipment, backboards or other cables. 12. Cabling in telecommunications rooms: a. For telecommunications rooms with ladder rack, lay cable neatly in ladder rack in even bundles and loosely secure cabling to the ladder rack at regular intervals with tie-wraps or hook-and-loop straps. 13. Cabling terminating on patch panels located on racks: a. Route cables in telecommunications rooms to patch panels on racks by routing across ladder rack across top of rack and then down vertical ladder rack to patch panel. b. Wherever possible, terminate cables consecutively according to their far-end termination in intuitively occurring groups (jacks in an outlet, outlets in a room, etc.).

B. Copper Cable: Terminate all pairs within a cable. Un-terminated cable pairs are not acceptable. 1. Provide station cable in the locations shown on the Contract Documents. Provide service loops for each outlet (minimum length of 18 inches) stored in the cable tray near the conduit serving the outlet. Provide service loops in telecommunications rooms (minimum length of 10 feet). a. For copper station cabling installed in wet areas, including floor boxes in slab-on-grade applications, use outdoor-rated CAT6 cabling. b. Route station cable that is exposed (not in conduit) to comply with ANSI/TIA/EIA-569 requirements for avoiding potential EMI sources and as follows: 1) 48 inches from motors or transformers 2) 12 inches from conduit and cables used for electrical power distribution 3) 5 inches from fluorescent lighting c. Cabling shall not share raceway with electrical power circuits, except for specifically designed system furniture raceways.

C. Fiber Optic Cable: Terminate all strands within a cable. Un-terminated cable strands are not acceptable. 1. Provide station cable in the locations shown on the Contract Documents. Provide service loops with a minimum length of 12 inches in outlet boxes and no less than 10 feet in the ER/TR's. a. For workstation outlets with both fiber and copper cabling, terminate fiber optic cabling after copper cabling has been installed and terminated.
Delete the following paragraph if there are no wet environment indoor fiber applications.
b. For fiber optic station cabling installed in wet areas, including floor boxes in slab-on-grade applications, use Indoor/Outdoor, plenum-rated, Wet Environment-rated cabling.
2. Innerduct
The Designer shall indicate in the Contract Documents where innerduct is required, consistent with the requirements described below.
a. Innerduct is required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling through all vertical riser pathways (conduits and sleeves) that exceed 4 feet in length.
b. Innerduct is also required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling through cable trays where larger outside plant cable shares the cable tray.
c. Otherwise, innerduct is not required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling. d. Where innerduct is required, install fiber optic cable in innerduct per manufacturer's
instructions. Innerduct shall terminate within 6 inches of top of each patch panel where fiber optic cable terminates. Secure innerduct with zip-ties at intervals not exceeding 24 inches. Do not use wire or tape. e. See Sections 27 13 00 and 33 82 00 for innerduct requirements related to fiber optic backbone cabling in inside plant and outside plant backbone applications, respectively.

D. Provide hook-and-loop cable managers for managing horizontal cabling in the telecommunications rooms. Cable managers shall be black colored. 1. Cut hook-and-loop cable managers to length, such that the cable bundle is encircled with a 50% overlap. 2. Cables shall be independently supported, not attached to other existing conduit, piping or equipment. 3. Zip ties are prohibited.

3.5

LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION

A. Color Coding: Apply industry standard color coding to cable termination fields. Always apply the same color at both ends of any given cable. Cross-connections are generally made between termination fields of different colors. The color may be applied to the backboard behind the termination equipment, may be the color of a cover on the termination equipment, or may be the actual color of the insert label on the termination equipment. Use the following color code: 1. Orange: Identification of the telecommunication service (telephone company) demarcation point. 2. Green: Identification of network connections on the customer side of the demarcation point. 3. Blue: Identification of the horizontal distribution (station) cables. A blue color coding is only required at the telecommunications room end of the cable, not at the station end of the cable. 4. Brown: Identification of inter-building backbone cables. 5. Yellow: Identification of auxiliary circuits, alarms, maintenance, security, and other miscellaneous circuits. 6. Red: Identification of key telephone systems.
B. Horizontal Cables: 1. Label Colors: White. 2. At Patch Panel: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the patch panel termination point (on the rear of the patch panel). Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping

applied over the label in order to permanently affix the label to the cable. Using transparent tape to affix labels to cables is not acceptable. b. Affix a second label on the front side of the patch panel adjacent to the screen-printed jack number where the cable terminates. c. Cables shall be labeled according to the following scheme:

aaaaa

aaaaa = Room Number where outlet is located

3. At Outlet: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the jack. Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping applied over the label in order to permanently affix the label to the cable. Using transparent tape to affix labels to cables is not acceptable. b. Affix a second label on the exterior of the faceplate, adjacent to the jack corresponding to the cable. c. Labeling shall be according to the following scheme:

aaaaa:bcdd

or

aaaaa:

bcdd

aaaaa = Telecom Room Number where patch panel is located b = Equipment Rack Number c = Patch Panel Number dd = Patch Panel Port Number

4. Apply the cable numbering shown in the horizontal cable labeling scheme found in the Appendix at the end of this specification section. For cable numbering that is not shown on the drawings, request numbering assignments from the Owner.
5. For outlets that are mounted above an accessible ceiling (such as for wireless access points), affix white adhesive label to the underside of the ceiling grid beneath the outlet such that the label is visible to a person walking through the room. The label's location shall allow a person to know which ceiling tile to remove to access the outlet.

C. Patch Panels: 1. General: Label patch panels as shown on the Contract Documents. 2. Label Colors: White. 3. Ports: Ports are typically pre-labeled by the manufacturer with sequential numbers (i.e. 1 to 48). Provide a label for each port that matches the label of the cable terminated on that port. See HORIZONTAL CABLES above. Do not cover the manufacturer's port numbering with the labels.

3.6

TESTING

A. Provide test records on a form approved by the Owner and Designer. Include the test results for each cable in the system. Submit the test results for each cable tested with identification as discussed under LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION above. Include the cable identifier, outcome of test, indication of errors found, cable length, retest results, and name and signature of technician completing the tests. Provide test results to the Owner and Designer for review and acceptance within two weeks of Substantial Completion. 1. Print test records for each cable within the system directly from the tester and submit in paper form (in a binder) and in electronic PDF format (on flash drive or CDROM) to the Owner and Designer for review. Handwritten test results will not be accepted.

B. Test the SCS after installation for compliance to all applicable standards as follows:

1. Copper: a. Horizontal Distribution: Test all pairs of each copper station cable, in accordance with the field test specifications defined in ANSI/TIA/EIA 568-B Category 6, and ANSI/TIA/EIA 568B standards and ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-C.2. This document will be referred to as the Category 6 Standard. The test equipment shall comply with the accuracy requirements for the level III field testers as defined in the TIA Cat 6 Document. To the extent possible, perform tests with building electrical systems fully powered on (i.e. Lights, HVAC, etc.). 1) Test each end-to-end link (the entire channel from the connector at the station to the connector or termination in the telecommunications room) utilizing sweep tests, for continuity, shield continuity, shorts, polarity, attenuation, installed length, transposition (wire map), mutual capacitance, characteristic impedance, resistance, ACR, Insertion Loss, Pair-to-Pair Near End Crosstalk (NEXT), Power Sum Near End Crosstalk (PSNEXT), Equal Level Far End Crosstalk (ELFEXT), Power Sum Equal Level Far End Crosstalk (PSELFEXT), Return Loss, and presence of AC voltage. Test each cable in both directions. 2) Use a TIA/EIA Level III or higher accuracy level testing instrument, re-calibrated within the manufacturer's recommended calibration period or within one year (whichever is more recent), with the most current software revision based upon the most current ANSI/TIA/EIA testing guidelines, capable of storing and printing test records for each cable within the system. a) Testing Device: Fluke DTX-1800, Micro-Test, Wirescope or Data Com Technologies, with latest software and hardware releases for TE CAT-6 horizontal distribution cables, or approved equal.
2. Fiber Optic: a. Horizontal Distribution: Test all strands following the procedure outlined in Section 27 13 00 ­ Communications Backbone Cabling.
C. Identify cables and equipment that do not pass to the Owner and Designer. Determine the source of the non-compliance and replace or correct the cable or the connection materials. Retest the cable or connection materials at no additional expense to the Owner. Provide a complete revised set of all test results to the Owner and Designer, in the same manner as above. Remove original individual cable test reports that are unacceptable and insert the new corrected cable test reports. Do not simply resubmit the test reports for the corrected cabling only. 1. In addition to the above, if it is determined that the cable is faulty, remove the damaged cable and replace it with a new cable. Cable repairs are not acceptable. The procedure for removing the cable shall be as follows: a. Prior to removal of damaged cable and installation of new cable: 1) Inform the Owner and Designer of the schedule for the removal and installation. 2) Test the new cable on the reel per paragraph B, above. 3) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether or not they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project. b. Remove the damaged cable and provide new cable. c. After the removal of the damaged cable and installation of the new cable: 1) Test the new cable per the paragraph titled TESTING. 2) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project. a) If any of the cables requiring testing are in use, coordinate with the Owner to schedule an outage opportunity during which the testing can be performed. d. If a cable which occupies the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as a damaged cable is damaged by the extraction and installation process, replace the cable at no additional expense to the Owner.
