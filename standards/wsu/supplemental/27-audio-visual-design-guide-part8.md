Video panels used for digital signage shall be wall-mounted using a secure, articulating wall mount. Security devices shall be installed to protect against theft.
Each digital signage application requires a double-gang electrical power outlet, concealed behind the video panel. This power outlet will support at least 3 devices that require 120VAC power.
Each application shall have the following low voltage jacks terminated in an outlet concealed behind the video panel:
· Two Category 6 cables are required for each Digital Signage video panel, terminated in the nearest telecommunications room or patch corded from a nearby GPON ONT.
· If GPON is used, the Designer shall coordinate with the telecommunications designer to determine a desirable location for the GPON ONT, potentially behind the video panel. o If the GPON ONT is to be located behind the video panel, provide additional pathway for Category 6 patch cords to be routed up to the corridor cable tray for use with other applications (such as WAPs, cameras, etc.).
· See TDDG for more information.
WSUP is currently exploring digital signage content solutions from Four Winds and Visix. The Designer shall inquire with the WSUP AVPM on a case-by-case basis about the requirements for a project.

7 Construction Document Content
This section of the AVDG describes the content requirements that the Designer shall include when creating the Construction Documents1. This content is in addition to the content found in some generally accepted document sets. The documents produced by the Designer and the services provided by the Designer shall comply with the requirements in the Conditions of the Agreement and the Instructions for Architects and Engineers doing Business with Division of Engineering and Architectural Services (published by the Washington State Department of General Administration). In addition to these requirements, the Designer shall also meet the requirements in this document, including the Construction Document content requirements in this section. Construction Documents shall communicate a fully detailed and coordinated design (rather than making adjustments in the field during construction), and are expected to result in reduced construction costs and fewer change orders. The level of detail required to meet this objective may be substantially greater than some audio/visual designers may be accustomed to providing. The Designer shall include the following content in the Construction Documents:
7.1 Plans and Drawings
7.1.1 GENERAL
The audio/visual portion of the Construction Drawing set shall include the following:
· Cover Sheet
· Sheet List
· Site Map
· Symbol Schedule
· List of Abbreviations
· Plan Sheets
· Elevation Diagrams
· Schematic Diagrams
· Construction Details
· Demolition
1 As of this writing, the Conditions of the Agreement and the Instructions for Architects and Engineers Doing Business with Division of Engineering and Architectural Services (both published by the Washington State Department of General Administration) make reference to the term "Construction Drawings." However, the Manual of Practice from the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) defines "Construction Documents" as a subset of the "Contract Documents" and indicates that drawings, specifications and other written documentation are contained within the Construction Document subset. The AVDG will use the term "Construction Documents" according to CSI's definition.

Construction Document Content
PLANS AND DRAWINGS
All plan sheets shall be scaled, shall indicate the scale, and shall show a north arrow. All plan sheets shall show a key plan when the building or site is too big to fit on a single sheet.
Equipment and cable identifiers shall be shown on the drawings and diagrams.

7.1.2 OUTSIDE PLANT SITE PLAN DRAWINGS
Typically, there will not be a large amount of audio/visual content on site plan drawings. However, video distribution cabling (fiber optic) between buildings will sometimes be designed on a project. In these cases, the telecommunications engineer will design the outside plant ductbanks and cabling, and the Audio/Visual Designer shall work with the telecommunications engineer to make sure that any audio/visual cabling needs are addressed.
Other outside plant audio/visual applications may include:
· Outdoor speakers in Plaza/Gathering areas · Access to indoor equipment for outdoor events

For projects where there is no telecommunications engineer but where outside plant cabling is required, the following requirements apply:
A. Provide drawings showing a scaled telecommunications distribution site plan. These drawings shall show the following:
· Maintenance hole or handhole locations (labeled with their identifiers) · Complete ductbank routing, details, and elevations · Conduit sizes, quantities, and arrangements · Section cuts · Existing and new surface conditions · Outside plant fiber optic telecommunications cabling, including fiber
types and strand counts · Locations of buildings, roads, poles, existing underground utilities, and
other obstructions
B. These sheets shall also identify coordination arrangements where conflicts with site work for other disciplines could possibly arise, in particular indicating the separation distances between low voltage and power or steam. The sequencing of site work shall also be shown, if applicable.

7.1.3 INSIDE PLANT PLAN DRAWINGS
A. Scaled plan drawings shall be provided for each building showing the audio/visual applications and cabling inside the building. These drawings shall show the following:
· Routing of new pathway to be constructed during the project. o The content of the drawings shall be coordinated with other disciplines and shall be representative of the complete pathway

route that the Contractor shall use, rather than a schematic depiction. o The Designer shall expend considerable coordination effort during the design process. Non-coordinated pathway/raceway is not acceptable to WSUP. · Approximate locations of junction boxes and conduit bends. · Backbone distribution cabling.
B. Where new cabling will be pulled into existing conduits, the Construction Documents shall show the routes of each existing conduit. Where it is not possible to determine the routing of existing conduits, the Designer shall inform the WSUP AVPM and seek direction on whether to use the existing conduits or design new conduits for use on the project. Typically, the Designer is required to identify such conditions during field investigation activities.

7.1.4 DEMOLITION
A. Any existing equipment and cabling intended to be no longer in use following the new installation shall be removed (salvaged and returned to the Owner undamaged and in working condition) as a part of the project. WSUP uses salvaged equipment as spare parts to support the existing equipment in other buildings. The Designer shall inquire with the AVPM for approval of the disposition of salvageable equipment and cabling.
B. Existing cabling to be demolished shall be shown on the plans and schematic diagrams. Separate demolition plan sheets and schematic diagrams shall be provided for projects with extensive cable demolition.
