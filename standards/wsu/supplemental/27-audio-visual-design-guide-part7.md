6.2 Active Lecture Halls
Active Lecture Halls (ALH) are sometimes called "Flipped" or "SCALE-UP" classrooms. In addition to the audio/visual features of General University Classrooms, they contain additional video panels and/or projectors to display student computer images.
In Active Lecture Halls, the instructor spends most of his or her time in the class period moving from table to table to support student groups as they collaboratively apply what they studied outside of class to solve the challenges given them in class. ALHs are not well-suited to video conferencing applications.
In ALHs, students sit in groups of up to 9 around each table. The tables are equipped with technology to support computers that are used by students during the class period. The wall near each table may have a video panel or a projection surface where the students can view it and can interact collectively.
ALHs also have a "front-of-room" projection wall where the instructor might present a limited amount of material; however, ALHs are not intended as lecture spaces. The front-of-room designation is a loosely used term, because the room is not intended to operate primarily in this mode, but will instead function most of each class period in a student-table-centric mode. The front-of-room projection shall also be able to display the monitor of any of the student tables should the instructor wish to feature a particular group for the entire class.
Depending on the intended use of an ALH space, it may not have an Instructor Podium. In such cases, the A/V Equipment Rack will need to be mounted inside casework.

6.2.2 A/V EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS
In addition to all of the features of a General University Classroom, Active Lecture Halls will also require video switching (equipment or software) and video panels as shown in the diagram and discussed below:

The Designer shall discuss the furniture layout and style with the AVPM. The Designer shall discuss the finish and desktop laminates with the Facilities Services Interior Designer.
6.2.2.1 VIDEO PANELS
Near each student group table, video panels shall be wall-mounted using a secure, articulating wall mount. Security devices shall be installed to protect against theft. Video panels shall be mounted no higher than is required to see the bottom of the image from any seat in the room.
Some Active Lecture Halls may be better served with projectors and projection screens. Typically, this decision shall be made during the Schematic Design or Design Development Phase, in conjunction with the WSUP user group/building committee. The Designer shall also discuss this option with the WSUP AVPM.
6.2.2.2 VIDEO SWITCHING
Video switching equipment and/or software will be required on two levels:
· At each table, the students will need to be able to choose which of their computers to show on the wall-mounted video panel or projection screen. Also, students should be able to choose to show the front-of-room projection on their wall-mounted video panel.

The Designer shall inquire whether there are opportunities to combine an A/V Equipment Room with a Telecommunications Room.

6.4.2.1 SIZING
A/V Equipment Rooms in new construction and full remodel projects shall be sized such that ADA-required space is available after equipment racks have been installed.
· Rooms shall be 9 feet by 10 feet (minimum dimensions), with the door on the 9foot side.

6.4.2.2 ARCHITECTURAL PROVISIONING
A. The Designer shall be responsible to inform the Architect about the architectural provisioning requirements for A/V Equipment Rooms, and to do this early in the Design Development phase of the project.
B. The Designer shall be responsible to review project documents and determine that the architectural requirements for the A/V Equipment Rooms are met as described in this document. For projects where an architect is involved, the Designer shall coordinate directly with the architect, and verify that the architect's design documentation meets these requirements. For projects without an architect, the Designer shall alert WSUP where additional architectural adjustments are needed to meet the requirements.
C. Doors shall open out (180-degree swing) from A/V Equipment Room spaces wherever possible, and shall be a minimum of 36" wide and 80" high, fitted with a lock. Coordinate lock and key requirements with WSUP. Doors shall be located in hallways or other common areas.
· The Designer shall inquire whether access control electronics are required for a given A/V Equipment Room.
A/V Equipment Room doors shall never be located in another building occupant's designated space.
· If Code or circumstances do not allow an outward swing, the room size shall be increased to accommodate an inward door swing.
D. Minimum clearance height within an A/V Equipment Room shall be 8 feet. False ceilings (t-bar ceilings, ceiling grids, etc.) shall not be installed in t A/V Equipment Rooms. The floor, walls, and ceiling shall be sealed to reduce dust.

AUDITORIUMS

F. The walls in A/V Equipment Rooms shall be covered either with plywood that has been treated with fire-retardant chemicals by a pressure impregnation process, or plywood that has been painted with a UL-listed, non-toxic fire-retardant intumescent coating having a Class A surface flame spread rating. The plywood shall be painted with primer and two coats of white paint.
· If an approved fire retardant intumescent coating is used, a small plaque shall be attached to the backboard near the door, listing the fire spread rating of the backboard, the manufacturer, and the product number of the fire-retardant intumescent coating. This information may be helpful for future maintenance activities.
Plywood backboards shall extend from 6" above the floor up to a height of 8'6" above the finished floor.
6.4.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONING
A. The Designer shall be responsible to inform the Mechanical Engineer of the environmental provisioning requirements for A/V Equipment Rooms, and to do this early in the Design Development phase of the project.
B. The Designer shall be responsible to determine that the mechanical HVAC requirements for the A/V Equipment Rooms are met as described in this document. For projects where a Mechanical Engineer is involved, the Designer shall coordinate directly with the engineer, and verify that the engineer's design documentation meets these requirements. For projects without the involvement of a Mechanical Engineer, the Designer shall alert WSUP where adjustments to the mechanical infrastructure are needed to meet the requirements.
C. The Designer shall coordinate with the Mechanical Engineer to ensure that the HVAC requirements for the A/V Equipment Rooms are met and also that HVAC ductwork and motors do not conflict with cable tray or conduit routing.
D. A/V Equipment Rooms shall be environmentally provisioned as follows:
1. A fundamental design assumption is that all A/V Equipment Rooms will contain active electronic equipment (Owner-provided) even if the current design does not call for such devices. A/V equipment requires an air conditioning system capable of operating on a 24/7/365 basis. If the building system cannot assure continuous cooling operation, a stand-alone unit shall be provided for the A/V Equipment Room.
In addition, a positive pressure differential with respect to surrounding areas is required to help keep dust and other particles out of the room.
· Where practical, the use of outside air for cooling is encouraged. Dehumidification and filtration may be required for systems using outdoor air.

WSU Pullman Campus ­ Audio/Visual Design Guide

February 6, 2015

Application Spaces
AUDITORIUMS
· Where practical, WSUP encourages the use of heat reclamation features. · Environmental management and monitoring systems shall be designed
for A/V Equipment Rooms. · Typically, the building's central air conditioning system should cool the
A/V Equipment Rooms during summer months. During the months when the central air conditioning system is not running, a stand-alone air conditioning system shall be used to cool the A/V Equipment Rooms. o This unit and any roof penetrations shall be located away from (not
directly above) electronics of any kind, to avoid damage from condensate drip and roof leaks. · Split systems are preferred, with the equipment located outside the A/V Equipment Rooms wherever possible. The temperature controls shall be located inside the A/V Equipment Rooms. · It is never acceptable to rely solely upon exhaust fans to cool an A/V Equipment Room. · WSUP currently has no preference for any particular manufacturer of air conditioning equipment, so long as it is quality equipment that is suitable for the application.
2. The Designer shall request power consumption data for the audio/visual equipment in the project, and shall work with the mechanical systems designer to ensure that the designed cooling capacity is sufficient to handle the A/V heat load.
3. Minimum clearance height in A/V Equipment Rooms shall be eight feet without obstructions (light fixtures, ducting, etc.).
4. The Designer shall carefully coordinate the location of fire suppression sprinklers and piping in A/V Equipment Room spaces.
· If fire suppression sprinklers are required in A/V Equipment Rooms, they shall be dual-action dry-pipe sprinkler systems.
· Sprinkler guards must be provided where sprinklers are installed less than 8 feet above the floor.
· Sprinkler heads and piping shall be mounted and routed above walking space ­ not above equipment racks or the equipment they will contain.
6.4.2.4 PROHIBITED SYSTEMS
Similar to the requirements for telecommunications rooms, the following shall not be located in or adjacent to A/V Equipment Rooms:
· Areas subject to water or steam infiltration, particularly basements. Floor drains (with trap primers) are required if there is any risk of water entry.
· Areas exposed to excessive heat or direct sunlight. · Areas exposed to corrosive atmospheric or environmental conditions. · Near or adjacent to potential sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI) or
radio frequency interference (RFI) such as large electric motors, power transformers, arc welding equipment, or high-power radio transmitting antennas.

BREAKOUT ROOMS
· In a shared space with electrical equipment other than panels serving the A/V equipment.
Water piping shall not be routed across the ceiling or through the walls of A/V Equipment Rooms.
6.4.3 ELECTRICAL POWER IN AUDITORIUMS
It is critical that all audio/visual equipment located in and serving an Auditorium be powered on the same phase of the electrical power distribution system, preferably through technology-dedicated electrical circuits, all on the same phase of the electrical power distribution system.
· This includes the equipment in the A/V Equipment Room, the equipment in the podium rack and the video projectors.
It is permissible for both an A/V Equipment Room and a Telecommunications Room to share the same technical power panel.
6.5 Breakout Rooms
Breakout Rooms are small conference rooms with space for approximately 4 to 8 people, and have a wall-mounted video panel with integrated speakers for presentation purposes only. Video conferencing features are not provided in Breakout Rooms.
Provide a conduit and box to support an A/V control pad, and a second box and faceplate to host an HDMI extension port. The Designer shall select a location that coordinates with furniture locations in this space. These features will enable users to connect their own mobile devices without requiring access to the HDMI ports on the rear of the video panel, and also to control the video panel without using the buttons on the panel.
WSUP currently uses the AMX Novara Control Pad for this purpose. The control pad shall provide the following functions:
· Video Panel On/Off · Volume Up/Down · HDMI Input Select

6.6.1.1.4 COLORS Neutral colors without patterns are better for wall areas that will be visible in the background of video conferencing images. The Architect shall carefully select wall treatments that will be compatible with video conferencing.
6.6.1.1.5 FURNITURE Each Presentation Conference Room requires built-in casework (located along the presentation wall, biased to one side) to host the A/V Equipment Rack. The casework is defined in Section 4.2.2 above.
A conference table with cable cubbies shall be provided to fit the room.
In each cable cubby, provide the following:
· Two electrical power receptacles · Two data jacks
In one cable cubby at the presentation end of the room, provide the following:
· One HDMI/DisplayPort jack · VGA Video input for a document camera or notebook computer · 3.5mm stereo audio jack
Chairs should be selected for comfort and utility in a conference setting.
6.6.1.2 ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS
6.6.1.2.1 POWER REQUIREMENTS Wherever possible, the electrical power circuits supplying the Projector, Video Panels, A/V Floor Box, and Equipment Rack (inside Casework) must be from the same breaker panel, and use the same phase in the panel.
Conduits for electrical power shall be ¾" trade size minimum.
Throughout the room, the A/V equipment that will require power includes:
· Conference Table (table-top cubbies) ­ quad outlet, mounted inside the table leg (preferred), or in a floor box.
· Video Panel(s) ­ wall-mounted power outlets typically concealed behind each video panel.
· Video Projector ­ wall-mounted power outlet typically located above the ceiling to support a short-throw projector.
· Projection Screen ­ If a projectable surface is not used, a motorized projection screen will be needed, requiring a hard-wired power circuit.
6.6.1.2.2 LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS If short-throw projectors are not used, pendant light fixtures shall be coordinated so that they do not obstruct the projector light path to the display wall. The projector shall
