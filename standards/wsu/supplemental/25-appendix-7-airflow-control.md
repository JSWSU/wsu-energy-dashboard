2. In operation, the VAV fume hood control process consists of calculating the fume hood exhaust flow necessary to provide the required average face velocity at any sash position based upon actual sash position and total fume hood open area. The controller shall then position the fume hood exhaust terminal damper to attain the required exhaust airflow in conjunction with constant feedback from an integral exhaust airflow sensor.

exhaust terminal damper in response to its airflow measurement feedback to ensure that the required fume hood exhaust is always maintained independently of variations in exhaust system static pressure or room conditions that could otherwise affect fume hood exhaust airflow.
i. The VAV fume hood controller shall initiate corrective action immediately upon sash movement and be completed when sash movement stops so as to restore the required average face velocity within 3 seconds after completion of sash movement.
ii. A "Sash Alert" feature shall provide periodic beeps at the Operator Display Panel when the sash remains open above the recommended safe working height (adjustable) for an adjustable period of time. This feature shall enhance fume hood safety operation and energy efficiency. This feature shall include a beep interval and be capable of being implemented on individual fume hoods as desired by authorized owner personnel.
B. Alerton / Phoenix Lab Controls provided variable air volume fume hood controller:
1. A fume hood monitor shall be provided to receive the sash sensor output, and presence and/or motion signal. This same monitor shall generate an exhaust airflow control signal for the appropriate airflow control device in order to provide a constant average face velocity. Audible and separate visual alarms shall be provided for flow alarm and emergency exhaust conditions. The fume hood monitor shall incorporate the following capabilities:
i. (Optional) LED display with the ability to display one of the following measurements:

ii. Alarm Muting option, which silences the audible alarm for an adjustable time period when the mute button is pushed. If another alarm is generated during the mute period, the new alarm will override the mute delay and the alarm will sound again.
iii. Auto Alarm Muting option, which sets the alarm to mute automatically after 20 seconds.
iv. Emergency Exhaust button with LED, which activates an emergency exhaust mode. In this mode, the exhaust air is at its maximum flow. When activated, the alarm will sound and the LED will flash. To activate emergency exhaust mode, push the button. Push the button again to cancel emergency exhaust mode.

v. Flow Alarm LED, which illuminates to indicate an unsafe airflow condition. The audible alarm will also activate and may be muted.
vi. Broken retracting cable alarm, an audible alarm with a flashing LED that indicates whether a vertical sash sensor cable is detached, thereby ensuring the fume hood users' safety.
vii. (Optional) Diversity Alarm LED that can be activated locally or from the BMS system. No audible alarm will be generated at the fume hood monitor.
viii.(Optional) Energy waste alarm option, which generates a local visual and audible alarm to notify when the fume hood sash is open beyond its minimum flow position and the lights in the room are off. When activated, the LED display will show "ENRG" and the audible alarm will sound until the sash is closed. The light levels at which the alarm is both initiated and cancelled shall be configurable.
ix. (Optional) Fume hood decommissioning option, which commands the exhaust flow through the fume hood to the minimum allowed by the exhaust valve when the sash is fully closed and no chemicals are present in the hood. The mode shall be initiated by either a pushbutton sequence on the fume hood monitor, external momentary switch input to the fume hood monitor, or a network command. When activated, the LED display will show "OFF," and the exhaust valve will move to its minimum position or shutoff position. Safety shall be built into the decommission option, whereby opening the fume hood sash will automatically return the fume hood exhaust to an in-use operating volume as determined by the sash sensor. Fume hood decommissioning shall be a point that can be integrated to the BMS system.
