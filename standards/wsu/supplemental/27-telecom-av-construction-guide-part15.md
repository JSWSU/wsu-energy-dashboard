PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1

SUMMARY

Review and edit the following list of generic type products and work for relevance to this project. This listing should not include procedures or processes, preparatory work, or final cleaning.

A. Provide all materials and labor for the installation of a pathway system for outside plant communications circuits. Work in this section includes excavation and trenching, conduit (raceway) construction, cutting and patching, concrete, maintenance hole and handhole construction, and landscaping.
Include this paragraph only if products will be furnished under this section but installed under other sections or by the Owner. WSUP frequently has the Contractor furnish patch cords, but uses their IT staff to install. When installations are "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (Owner- Installed Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

B. Products installed (but not furnished) under this section -
Include this paragraph only if products will be installed under this section but furnished under other sections or by the Owner. For example, WSUP may pre-purchase fiber, but have the Contractor install. When products are furnished "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (OwnerFurnished Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

DEFINITIONS

Review and edit the following list of definitions for applicability to this project. Add and/or remove definitions for unusual terms that are not explained in the conditions of the Contract and that are used in ways not common to standard references.

NOTE: Furnish, provide and install are used repeatedly throughout this specification. The Designer shall ensure that these terms are identified in the appropriate section of the project manual. The definitions of these terms shall be similar to the following:

Furnish - "Supply and deliver to the project site, ready for unloading, unpacking, assembly, installation and similar operations".

Install - "Operations at the project site including unloading, unpacking, assembly, erection, placing, anchoring, applying, working to dimension, finishing, curing, protecting, cleaning and similar operations".

Provide - "To furnish and install, complete and ready for the intended operation".

A. Aggregate: Mineral materials such as sand or stone used in making concrete

B. Backfill: Earth material used specifically for filling and grading excavations back to a finished state. Backfill is placed on top of the bedding surrounding encased ductbanks and direct-buried conduits.

C. Base: Earth material used specifically to level and grade a subgrade for the subsequent placement of encased ductbanks, direct-buried conduit, maintenance holes and handholes. Base material is placed on top of the subgrade and beneath the bedding surrounding encased ductbanks, conduits, maintenance holes or handholes.

D. Bedding: Earth material used specifically for filling excavations. Bedding is placed around encased ductbank, conduits, maintenance holes or handholes. Bedding is placed on top of the base and beneath the backfill.

E. Fill: The collective term for base, bedding, and backfill.

F. Handhole (HH): A structure similar to a small maintenance hole through which cable can be pulled, but not large enough for a person to fully enter to perform work.
G. Maintenance Hole (MH): A vault located in the ground or earth as part of an underground conduit system and used to facilitate placing, connectorization, and maintenance of cables as well as the placing of associated equipment, in which it is expected that a person will enter to perform work.
H. RNC: Rigid Non-Metallic Conduit (PVC)

I. PSC: PVC Coated Rigid Steel Conduit.

1.5

SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

Review and edit the following list of submittals as applicable to this project. Note that the submittals listed below are specific to this section only. Division 1, Section 01 30 00 (or equivalent) ­ Submittals should include general administrative requirements (e.g. schedule, number of copies, distribution, etc.). Either Section 01 30 00 or this section should include a statement similar to the following, "The Contractor shall apply Contractor's stamp, sign, or initial certifying that review, verification of required Products, and coordination of information is in accordance with the requirements of the work and Contract Documents.

Any deviations from the Contract Documents or specified product data shall be clearly noted, and must be approved by the Designer prior to start of construction. The Designer shall obtain approval from WSUP through the Standards Variance Request (SVR) process prior to approving a Contractor-submitted deviation.

If the deviation is not approved by the Designer it remains the Contractor's responsibility to provide what is required in the Contract Documents".

A. Quality Assurance/Control Submittals: Provide submittal information for review as follows: 1. Submit a copy of the delivery receipt for each concrete delivery. Include date, strength ordered, and location used.

1.6

SEQUENCING

State any requirements for coordinating work with potentially unusual or specifically required sequencing. WSUP may choose to construct a project under two bid packages one for OSP Site Work as described in this specification section as well as other General Contractor specific work, and a second bid package for the Structured Cabling System. The Designer must coordinate with WSUP to determine if two bid packages will be used and include verbiage in the appropriate specification sections requiring the contractors to coordinate construction phasing and schedules. Coordinate this paragraph with the conditions of the contract and Division 1 requirements to ensure that no statements are made that will limit or void those conditions. A thorough understanding of the warranties applicable on this project is required. The Designer shall consider and account for unique warranty situations that may arise from owner furnished equipment, owner installed equipment, or other situations that may conflict with warranty requirements.
