5.6 Administration / Labeling

5.6.1 NUMBERING SCHEME
WSUP's standard numbering scheme is required for all audio/visual infrastructure: All sequential numbering consists of a 2-digit number with a leading zero for numbers less than 10. All sequence numbers are preceded by a hyphen (dash).

5.6.1.1 EQUIPMENT

Each piece of equipment receives a unique identifier:

Equipment Type
Controller Touch Panel PTZ Camera
Camera Codec Video Conference
Video Switcher Computer
Computer Monitor Doc Cam Laptop
Video Wall Processor Audio Mixer
Digital Signal Processor Projector
Video Panel Distribution Amplifier Assistive Listening
Speaker

Abbreviation
IC TP PTZ CAM VCDX VS IBMA IBMB DC IBML VWP MX DSP VP LCD DA ADA SP

5.6.1.4 CABLE LABELS
Cable labels are comprised of three parts: · Cable Number · Equipment Number (where the near end of the cable terminates) · Connection Number (where the near end of the cable terminates)

Each cable is labeled with its own cable identifier plus the piece of equipment and connection point on which the cable terminates, as follows:
CABLETYPE - ## EQUIPTYPE - ## PORTTYPE - ##
