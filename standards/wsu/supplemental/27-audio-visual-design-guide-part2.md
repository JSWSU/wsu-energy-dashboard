WSUP Audio/Visual Policies
GETTING HELP FROM AMS

2 WSUP Audio/Visual Policies
The following policies apply to anyone that may be involved in the design, installation, maintenance or use of audio/visual systems at a WSUP facility.

2.1 Getting Help from AMS
All requests for A/V assistance should be submitted to Academic Media Services (AMS):
· Call 509.335.7336 · Email ams@wsu.edu
When your request is received, it will be evaluated by AMS and assigned to the appropriate specialists to address your needs.
AMS is most efficient in meeting your needs when you work through our normal channels. We are committed to applying our best efforts to address each request in a timely and professional manner.

2.1.1 DO NOT ALTER CABLING OR EQUIPMENT
Audio/visual equipment and its associated cabling shall not be altered by anyone outside AMS. Doing so will cause interoperability problems with equipment and may void manufacturer warranties.
Please do not:
· Remove installed connectors · Attempt to access locked panels · Remove patch cables
Anyone needing help with cabling should contact AMS for assistance.

2.2 Facilities Services
The following information is intended to assist representatives in the Facilities Services department as spaces are planned and during the construction and commissioning of buildings.

2.2.1 AUDIO/VISUAL FEATURES IN BUILDING SPACES
In the life of a building, technology advances occur, systems become obsolete, and the cabling and equipment components of the technology infrastructure will be changed several times. In order to keep the life-cycle costs low, it is essential that spaces and pathways supporting technology infrastructure are properly sized, properly located, and remain accessible.

WSUP Audio/Visual Policies
FACILITIES SERVICES

Please use the following guidelines when considering the audio/visual features of spaces in new projects:

2.2.1.1 GENERAL UNIVERSITY CLASSROOMS

o Room Control Panel application o Lecture Capture application o Standard Office & Presentation
software · Acoustic wall treatment as required

2.2.1.2 ACTIVE LECTURE HALLS
Active Lecture Halls (ALH) are sometimes called "Flipped" or "SCALE-UP" classrooms, and typically include student workspace clusters with a video panel or projector for each cluster. In addition to the audio/visual features of a General University Classroom, they also contain:
· Additional video panels and/or projectors to display student computer images.
· Additional microphones and associated equipment as needed.
· Wireless/wired collaborative screen-sharing.

2.2.1.5 BREAKOUT ROOMS

Breakout Rooms are spaces for several people to meet. A Breakout Room has a video panel with integrated speakers for presentation audio/visual features, including:

· Video panel (with integrated speakers)

· External HDMI connection for user devices

Breakout Rooms do not include the equipment needed for video conferencing. However, if a user's mobile device is equipped with a camera and microphone, then the room could be used for video conferencing.

2.2.1.6 PRESENTATION CONFERENCE ROOMS

It is recommended that a Conference Room (either Presentation or Collaborative) be provided for each major floor in a building.
Presentation Conference Rooms have the following audio/visual features:

· Audio/visual equipment rack (housed inside built-in casework)

2.2.1.8 LARGE CONFERENCE ROOMS

Large Conference Rooms (Presentation or Collaborative) have the same audio/visual features as regular Conference Rooms. However, it is usually necessary to expand the audio/visual features, for example:

· Additional video panels · Additional audio signal processing

· Additional speakers · Additional ceiling-hung microphones

2.2.1.9 INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA STUDIOS

Instructional Media Studios are used to prepare audio/visual media for instructional and or training purposes. Lectures or demonstrations can be recorded (both audio and video) and streaming media files can be produced in this space.

The space is sized similar to an office and will require a movable table.

The following audio/visual features are required:

· Audio/visual equipment rack (floorstanding)
· Computer with two video panels for lecture capture and presentation software
· Ultra-short-throw projector and projectable whiteboard surface
· Cameras · Document camera

· Blu-ray/DVD player · VOIP telephone · Speakers · Microphone (lapel, desktop or ceiling-
hung) · Acoustic wall treatment · Specialty lighting as needed

2.2.1.10 DIGITAL SIGNAGE
Video panels are wall-mounted and used to display announcements and other information.
Where applicable, the video panels may also be provided with touch-interaction capability.
WSUP uses a variety of content sources to display information on digital signage. Consult with the AVPM regarding the appropriate solution for each application.

2.2.1.11 OUTDOOR PLAZA / GATHERING SPACES
Outdoor public gathering spaces can be used for group events requiring public address systems to communicate with larger groups. The following features are needed:
· Power outlets · Speakers mounted on poles · Wireless network access points

2.2.2 SYSTEM INTEGRATION
Significant technical advances have been made in recent years resulting in numerous systems that now communicate with audio/visual systems and with networks. The following are examples of systems or processes that should be integrated with audio/visual systems:
· Window coverings/sunshades (in conference rooms) · Folding walls (to divide rooms) · Lighting control systems
These systems shall use wired-network connectivity. Do not expect wireless networking to provide the capacity, reliability or security required to handle these systems.
It is therefore crucial to the success of these systems that Facilities Services coordinate with AMS and ITS during the planning and design phases to ensure that adequate network and infrastructure are included in the design.
2.2.3 DOCUMENTATION
2.2.3.1 AS-BUILT / RECORD DRAWINGS
When a construction project is completed, the as-built drawings and record drawings need to be made available to AMS and ITS as follows:
· Full-size hardcopy printed drawings ­ the portion of the drawing set that is applicable to technology. The full set is not required, just the sheets that depict the technology features of the project.
· The A/V Contractor's as-built drawings are extremely important for maintenance of the A/V systems. Please obtain both hardcopy and CAD files of these drawings.
· The A/V Contractor's software configuration files and software settings (used in the A/V equipment) are also required for WSU to maintain the A/V systems. Please obtain the uncompiled, editable configuration files and software settings for each A/V component.

Project Procedures
DESIGNER QUALIFICATIONS

3 Project Procedures
The Project Procedures section contains guidelines for architects, engineers, and audio/visual systems designers regarding the procedures that WSUP requires for projects that include audio/visual systems. This applies both to projects that entail primarily audio/visual work (such as classroom or conference room upgrade projects) as well as to architectural projects and other work (such as a new building or campus) that involve audio/visual design.
This section is not intended to supersede the requirements in the State of Washington Conditions of the Agreement or the State of Washington Instructions for Architects and Engineers, but rather to complement them, providing additional requirements that apply specifically to audio/visual design projects at WSUP facilities.
It is intended that the requirements in this section be considered contractually binding for professional design firms providing audio/visual design services.
