INTRODUCTION
1 Preface
1.1 Introduction
A. The Construction Guide Specification (CGS) is written to communicate the requirements of the Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus for the installation of technology infrastructure and systems at WSUP facilities.
B. The CGS is written for an audience of Architects, Engineers and Designers who are responsible for the design of new or remodeled facilities at WSUP where technology infrastructure currently exists or will be installed. It is intended to assist in developing specifications for a particular project and to communicate WSUP's requirements for the appropriate construction and installation of technology infrastructure and systems at WSUP-owned and leased facilities.
C. This document also applies to infrastructure designed and installed by WSUP staff, when a formal design is not developed.
D. The CGS consists of several sections written based on the 2014 Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) format (www.csinet.org), using Master Format, Section Format, and Page Format structuring guidelines. The CGS reflects WSUP and industry standards in effect as of the date of this publication.
E. The Construction Guide Specification and this Preface (CGSP) belong to a set of documents (depicted below) that comprise the standard design and installation practices for all facets of technology systems and infrastructure at WSUP's facilities. This document forms the core of the Construction Guide Specification document set.
F. The Construction Guide Specification Preface (CGSP) is a key companion to the Design Guides.
· Designers shall adapt the various CGS sections "as written" for creating specifications for a particular project according to the instructions in the Design Guides. In other words, Designers shall use the electronic specification section documents (provided by WSUP in Microsoft Word format) and then shall make any project-specific edits to the specifications in those documents.
· Rewriting sections in the CGS or modifying the format structure or requirements will not be accepted.

DOCUMENT INTENT

G. It is the responsibility of the Designer of technology infrastructure for WSUP to coordinate with the other designers on a project (architectural, electrical, mechanical, etc.) to determine that other systems are both compatible with and complementary to the technology infrastructure. It is critical to coordinate between disciplines during the design phase of a project, rather than making adjustments in the field during construction.
H. This document was prepared by Summit Engineering & Consulting, P.S. and by the Information Technology Services department at the Pullman campus of Washington State University. As technology and needs evolve, the document will be periodically updated.
· June 24, 2015 ­ Originally published

1.2 Document Intent
The CGS has been developed with the intent that WSUP standards and practices are followed during the design and construction of technology systems.
Each CGS specification section includes standards, guidelines, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to

WSU Pullman Campus ­ Technology Infrastructure Construction Guide Specification

Preface
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
many WSUP projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Engineer/Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP projects. For WSUP staff performing telecommunications work, this information shall be followed to fulfill the requirements of a fully compliant installation.
Each CGS section includes products upon which WSUP has standardized and which were current at the time the specification section was written. When newer products become available, or when a different product appears to be better suited for a particular project, the Designer, Contractor or Installer shall bring this recommendation to the attention of the WSUP TPM for review and final approval before making changes to the CGS section or installing the newer or different product.
The CGS is intended to be a "Guide Specification" rather than a "Master Specification". The products listed and other information included in each section are not intended to be all-inclusive for any given project. Instead, each specification section is meant to serve as a starting point for developing the specification section for a given project, with content to be added or removed as required. However, all additions and changes must be pre-approved as indicated above.
In addition to implementing WSUP standards and practices, the intent of the CGS is to reduce the time required for WSUP staff to review project specifications. WSUP has determined that following these instructions will reduce the review time required for each project.
Unless otherwise stated, the information in the CGS applies to both new construction and remodel projects and (as appropriate) to leased facilities.

1.3 How to Use this Document
The CGS shall be used in conjunction with the corresponding Design Guide (xDG) to produce Construction Documents for bidding or to assist WSUPselected personnel in the design and administration of small technology infrastructure construction projects.
WSUP will provide the CGS specification sections to the Designer electronically as Microsoft Word documents. The Designer shall then edit the Microsoft Word document for each specification section using the latest version of Microsoft Word, adding or removing content as required to meet the unique needs of a given project.
It is not acceptable to create new specification sections based on the Designer's interpretation of the "intent" of the CGS, or to cut and paste content from CGS sections into other existing specification sections.
All edits made by the Designer to the original CGS electronic documents shall be made using Microsoft Word's Tracking Changes feature. The specification sections shall be submitted in hardcopy format when required
