6.1.1.2 ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS
6.1.1.2.1 CLASSROOM LOCATION Noise-producing equipment (such as elevators and HVAC equipment), shall be separated from teaching spaces. While soundproofing can treat some problems, it has its limits and can be expensive.
6.1.1.2.2 ROOM SHAPE Classrooms should be longer than they are wide. Window walls should be perpendicular to the presentation wall.
6.1.1.2.3 ACOUSTICS A noise coefficient of NC 35 and a reverberation time of 0.6 seconds are the highest allowable per the recommendations of ANSI S12.60-2002.
The Designer and the Architect shall discuss with the Owner whether there is any possibility that a General University Classroom might be upgraded in the future to serve as Distance Education Classroom.
· If this possibility exists, the acoustics for the classroom shall be designed to meet the Distance Education Classroom requirements from day one.
A. Walls shall be at least 6" thick. They shall employ sound-dampening material and construction methods to suppress sound transfer between application spaces.
B. Acoustic treatment shall be employed on walls, floors, and ceilings to reduce reverberant conditions. This treatment shall have an NRC of 80-85, which is typical of fabric over 1" fiberglass. Extraneous sounds must be prevented from entering the classroom. In some cases this might require dense materials in ceilings and walls. Carpeting is highly desirable to improve acoustics and visual imagery.

6.1.1.2.4 COLORS The Designer and the Architect shall discuss with the Owner whether there is any possibility that a General University Classroom might be upgraded in the future to serve as a Distance Education Classroom.
· If this possibility exists, the color treatments in the classroom shall be designed to meet the Distance Education Classroom requirements from day one.
6.1.1.2.5 WINDOWS If there are windows in the room, automatic blackout shades to control light spill shall be considered.
6.1.1.2.6 FURNITURE When selecting student tables, consider whether power outlets or push-to-talk buttons for microphones will be required. If so, it is recommended that tables be manufactured with integrated cable raceways.
The Designer shall work with the WSUP FS Interior Designers to specify the table colors and tabletop surface materials.
6.1.1.3 ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS
6.1.1.3.1 POWER REQUIREMENTS The electrical power circuits supplying the Projector, Video Panels, Instructor's Podium, Floor Box, and Equipment Rack shall be dedicated for technology applications, be from the same breaker panel and use the same phase in the panel.
· Power for projection screens is not required to be from the same phase.
The Equipment Racks in the Instructor's Podium can share a single dedicated 20A circuit.
Conduits for electrical power shall be ¾" trade size minimum.
Throughout the room, the A/V equipment that will require power includes:
· Video Projector ­ ceiling-mounted power outlet typically located flush with the underside of the ceiling to support a standard-throw or ultra-short-throw projector.
· A/V Rack ­ quad outlet per rack, mounted on the floor of the podium casework (inside).
· Projection Screen ­ if a projectable surface is not used, a motorized projection screen may be needed, requiring a separate power circuit and a low-voltage control interface.
6.1.1.3.2 LOW-VOLTAGE PATHWAYS AND BOXES A. A/V conduits shall be sized 1" minimum, and shall be larger as required for each
application.

B. Provide an A/V Junction Box above the ceiling as shown in the plan diagram above.
Provide conduits from the A/V Junction Box down to the underside of the Instructor Podium, stubbed up 1" above the floor.
Provide a separate 1" conduit routed from the Instructor Podium to the main distribution cable tray (typically in the corridor) for telecommunications cabling. Do not route this cabling exposed through the optional in-room wire basket, because this may require the data cabling to be plenum-rated.
If an A/V Floor Box is used under an Instructor Podium, it shall only function as a cable pass-through point. Cabling shall not terminate in an A/V Floor Box. The Designer shall discuss the need for an A/V Floor Box with the WSUP AVPM prior to inclusion in the design.
C. Provide conduits (minimum 1" trade size) from the A/V Junction Box to in-wall, 2 1/8" deep device boxes, with a single gang mud ring serving each wall-mounted audio/visual device. Provide faceplates with circular holes in the plates that are large enough for connectorized cables to pass through. Provide blank faceplates for future devices. Conduits, device boxes, and faceplates shall comply with WSUP telecommunications guidelines. Faceplates shall match (color, material, style) the other faceplates used in the project.
· Be aware that some PTZ cameras mount directly to a 2-gang mud ring.
D. Optional: Provide wire basket cable trays in accessible ceiling to accomplish the functions depicted in the plan diagram above. Cable tray practices shall comply with WSUP telecommunications guidelines. If an in-room wire basket is provided (optional), provide conduits from the A/V Junction Box to the wire basket.

6.1.1.3.4 LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS If Ultra Short-throw projectors are not used, pendant light fixtures shall be coordinated so that they do not obstruct the projector light path to the display wall. Standard-throw projectors are typically hung between 6 and 12 inches below the finished ceiling to cener of lens, and set back from the front of the room a distance of twice the screen width minus 2 feet.
Front-of-room lighting must be controllable separately from the rest of the room to eliminate spill on the screen causing a reduction of image contrast.
6.1.1.4 HVAC REQUIREMENTS
In order to meet the above Noise Coefficient, the HVAC, must be low velocity with sound absorption material in the ducts.
HVAC designers shall anticipate that A/V equipment will produce a heat gain of approximately 1500 watts in the classroom.
Since students will occupy these rooms for up to three hours at a time at intense levels of concentration, there must be temperature control, humidity control and complete changes of air on a cycle consistent with that type of activity.
6.1.1.5 A/V EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS
6.1.1.5.1 INSTRUCTOR PODIUM Instructor Podium furniture shall be located in the front of the classroom, to the side of the display area of the front wall, away from the door. The Podium shall be visible from every seat in the space, but shall not obstruct the line of sight to the projection screen from any seat in the space. Podiums shall be anchored to the floor, preferably in an angled orientation.
6.1.1.5.2 A/V EQUIPMENT RACK An A/V Equipment Rack assembly shall be located inside the instructor podium. The cabling shall enter the rack at the bottom rear, and be securely anchored to the rack. The A/V Equipment Rack shall contain the following equipment:
· AMX controller system, which shall be connected to the University data network. · Blu-ray/DVD player, if required. · Owner-provided computer. The Designer shall inquire with the WSUP AVPM
whether the computer will be rack-mountable or whether the Designer shall include a 2U shelf to support the computer. · Wireless microphone receiver · Video Switcher/Scaler · Audio Switcher/DSP · Amplifier

· Ventilation Fans
· In Instructor Podiums, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices shall be provided to support the equipment in the A/V Racks.
An example A/V Equipment Rack elevation detail is shown in Appendix 8.1.1.
6.1.1.5.3 FLOOR BOX
Typically, a floor box beneath the Instructor Podium is undesirable. Instead, WSUP prefers that low-voltage conduits serving the technology applications in the Podium simply stub up approximately 1" above the floor, and enter the Podium through cutouts in the floor of the Podium. However, if a floor box is required, no cabling shall terminate in it, but rather the floor box shall serve as a pass-through point.
6.1.1.5.4 VIDEO PROJECTOR
Discuss with the WSUP AVPM which type of project should be used for a given project. Standard throw projectors are typically preferred. However, where a standard throw projector cannot be used, consider using a ceiling-mounted ultra-short or long-throw projector.
AC power will be required for the projector.
6.1.1.5.5 PROJECTION SCREEN
Where a projectable surface is used, do not use a projection screen.
Otherwise, projection screens shall be mounted in a central location in the front of the room. Screen shall be mounted a maximum of 4 inches away from the wall and shall clear the chalk tray of any black or white board-mounted behind it when extended. The bottom of the fully-extended screen shall be a minimum of 36 inches above the finished floor.
A manual screen control switch is not desired. However, a power cutoff switch above the ceiling is desired so that technicians can disconnect the screen from power for servicing activities.
The Designer shall consult with the WSUP AVPM regarding the desired screen sizes in each application.
6.1.1.5.6 SPEAKERS
The classroom audio system shall be designed with separate speaker systems to provide a clearly intelligible stereo (for content) and monaural (for speech) audio signal at every location within the classroom. Audio enhancement shall provide a level of not less than 55 dB SPL at 48 inches above finished floor in the classroom seating area. Audio levels front to back/side to side shall not vary by more than 2dB at any point within the seating area.
6.1.1.5.7 ROOM CONTROL
The AMX room control system shall provide control of the video display devices, projection screen, content source selection (audio and video), window dressing, and lighting.

The Designer shall discuss with the AVPM which room-specific features shall be programmed into the control system.
6.1.1.5.7.1 Room Control Programming All programming for the AMX Processor and all touch panels shall be coordinated with the WSUP AVPM. Every touch panel and PC software interface in use has the same page layout and button nomenclature throughout the campus and all additions must follow suit.
6.1.1.5.7.2 Projector Control Power on/off and input selections on the projector are selected by the AMX system. The AMX system shall also provide for the automated lowering and raising of the projection screen with the projector on/off control.
6.1.1.5.7.3 Lighting If remotely controllable lighting is used in the classroom, the AMX control system shall be programmed to provide lighting control, automated with the use of the video projector. The lighting system shall also be given a separate control page for overriding the automated control as needed.
6.1.1.5.7.4 Codec The following feature shall be programmed into the codec:
· Set to Auto Answer incoming calls
The Designer shall discuss with the AVPM which room-specific features shall be programmed into the codec.
6.1.1.5.7.5 Audio and Video Routing and Switching Audio and video routing shall be done with the AMX control system. The room control system performs source selections via peripheral equipment to provide sources to the video projector and the conference codec.
6.1.1.5.7.6 Content Switcher When WSUP uses the AMX Enova All-In-One Digital Media switcher, the switcher is used for all video source selections including computer, laptop, Blu-ray/DVD and document camera. The Polycom codec is used for camera source selection.
6.1.1.5.7.7 Touch Panel The Designer shall inquire with the WSUP AVPM which of three options shall be provided for room control:
· Option #1: WSU's custom software interface that runs on the Instructor Computer.
· Option #2: Polycom Touch Panel.
· Option #3: AMX 10" (maximum) diagonally measured color display. The touch panel shall be placed on the Instructor's podium.
