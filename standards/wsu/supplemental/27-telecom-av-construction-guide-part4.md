b. Where sizing is not shown on the Contract Documents, size junction box width according to the following formula: 1) From the table below, select the width associated with the largest conduit on the distribution side of the box. For each additional distribution conduit, add the "Increase Width" value associated with the size of that distribution conduit to the box width for the largest distribution conduit. a) For example, if the distribution side of the junction box has one 1-¼" distribution conduit and three 1" distribution conduits, the total distribution-side width would be 6"+2"+2"+2"=10". 2) Repeat the above process for the feeder side of the junction box. Junction boxes are typically fed by a single conduit, therefore unless the box has more than one feeder conduit, the "Increase Width" part of the formula is unnecessary. a) For example, if the feeder side of the junction box has two 2" feeder conduits the total feeder-side width would be 8"+5"=13". 3) The larger of the two width calculations (distribution side vs. feeder side) shall be the width of the junction box to be provided. a) For example, if the distribution-side width were 10" and the feeder-side width were 13", provide a 13" wide junction box.

4. Where junction boxes are to be mounted on ceiling structure above ceiling grid, do not mount

higher than 4 feet above grid (mount on wall instead).

5. Install hinged-cover enclosures and cabinets plumb, and supported at each corner.

6. Install junction boxes so that the access door opens from the side where the cable installer will

normally work ­ typically from the bottom (floor side) of the box.

a. Where a junction box is installed in a ceiling space, provide full access to the junction box

door and adequate working room for both the installation personnel and for proper looping

of cable during installation.

b. Provide a lockable access cover (or junction box door if junction box is exposed) in hard lid

ceilings.

7. Install junction boxes such that conduits enter and exit at opposite ends of the box as follows:

I. Pull Boxes: 1. Provide pull boxes as shown on the Contract Documents and as required. a. Where sizing is not shown on the Contract Documents, size pull boxes as follows:

Size of Largest Conduit 1" 1-¼" 1-½" 2" 2-½" 3 3-½" 4"

Box Width
4" 6" 8" 8" 10" 12" 12" 15"

Box Length
12" 12" 12" 24" 24" 36" 48" 60"

Box Depth
4" 4" 4" 4" 6" 6" 6" 6"

b. Where a pull box is required with conduits 1 inch trade size or smaller, an outlet box may be used as a pull box. Where outlet boxes are used as pull boxes, the outlet boxes shall be dedicated for use as a pull box and shall not host cable termination hardware.
2. A pull box may not be substituted for a 90-degree bend. 90 degree condulets (LB's) are not acceptable.
3. Install pull boxes in an accessible location, readily accessible both at time of construction and after building occupation. Do not install pull boxes in inaccessible interstitial building space.
4. Where pull boxes are to be mounted on ceiling structure above ceiling grid, do not mount higher than 4 feet above grid (mount on wall instead).
5. Install hinged-cover enclosures and cabinets plumb, and supported at each corner. 6. Install pull boxes so that the access door opens from the side where the cable installer will
normally work (typically from the bottom, or floor side, of the box). a. Where a pull box is installed in a ceiling space, provide full access to the junction box door
and adequate working room for both the installation personnel and for proper looping of cable during installation.

GROUNDING/BONDING:

A. Grounding and bonding work shall comply with the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, WAC, National Electrical Code, UL 467, ANSI/TIA/EIA standards and the references listed in Section 27 05 00 ­ "Common Works Results for Communications" PART 1 ­ STANDARDS AND CODES, as well as local codes which may specify additional grounding and/or bonding requirements. 1. Bond metallic raceway together and to the nearest TGB (as provided under Section 27 05 26 ­ "Grounding and Bonding for Communications Systems"). Ensure that bonding breaks through paint to bare metallic surface of painted metallic hardware.

B. Conduits and Sleeves: 1. For conduits and sleeves terminating at a cable tray, provide a bonding conductor to the cable tray grounding conductor, terminated with bonding lugs. Where multiple conduits terminate adjacent to each other, it is permissible to daisy-chain the bonding conductor between conduits and route a single conductor to the cable tray grounding conductor. 2. For conduits and sleeves terminating in a telecommunications room, provide a bonding conductor to the TGB or TMGB in that room. Where multiple conduits terminate adjacent to each other, it is permissible to daisy-chain the bonding conductor between conduits and route a single conductor to the TGB or TMGB.

C. For Wire Gutter: 1. Provide a continuous grounding conductor running the length of the wire gutter. 2. Bond each section of wire gutter to the grounding conductor. 3. Ensure that the grounding/bonding hardware breaks through painted surfaces.

3.5

LABELS:

A. Conduits: Label each conduit end in a clear manner by designating the location of the other end of the conduit (i.e. room name, telecommunications room name, pull box identifier, outlet identifier, etc.). Use the label of the first port of the outlet as the outlet identifier. Indicate conduit length on the label. 1. Where a conduit is intended for future cabling use outside of the Contract, the conduit shall be labeled in a clear manner by designating the location of the other end of the conduit (i.e. room name, telecommunications room name, pull box identifier, etc.) along with a sequential number for each spare conduit terminated into a single room. Indicate conduit length on the label. a. Suggestion: The second spare conduit (whether spare or in use) between Room 100 and telecommunications room 1A might be labeled in the telecommunications room as "100 #2, __ feet." In Room 100 the same conduit might be labeled "1A - #2, __ feet."

B. Pull Boxes: Label each pullbox with a unique identifier. Identifiers shall be of the form "RN-Y" where "RN" is the room name of the room closest to (or containing) the pull box, and "Y" is the sequential number of the pull box for each "RN".

1. Example: The second pull box in the vicinity of room "100" would have the label "100-2".

3.6

PROTECTION

A. Provide final protection and maintain conditions, in a manner acceptable to manufacturer and in accordance with accepted industry practice, that ensure coatings, finishes, and cabinets are without damage or deterioration at the time of Substantial Completion. 1. Repair damage to galvanized finishes with zinc-rich paint recommended by manufacturer. 2. Repair damage to PVC or paint finishes with matching touchup coating recommended by manufacturer.

3.7

CLEANING

1. On completion of installation (including outlet fittings and devices), inspect exposed finish.

Remove burrs, dirt, and construction debris and repair damaged finish, including chips, scratches,

and abrasions.
