DIVISION 08 ­ OPENINGS 08 51 00 METAL WINDOWS

PART 1 - GENERAL

1.01 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

A. All sashes are to be aluminum with thermal barrier sash members. All windows must be designed with provisions for operating, cleaning, and re-glazing from the interior.

B. If pivoted windows are used, be sure that weatherstrip seals will not be damaged by rotation in either direction. Pivoted windows are to rotate 180 degrees (or as possible with seals) in a vertical plane to allow cleaning.

C. WSU discourages the use of metal clad wood-frame windows. These have a demonstrated history of high maintenance and relatively short service life at WSU, due to temperature and weather extremes.

D. Windows shall be provided with both locking and latching capabilities. Locks are to be such that they can only be operated by a special tool, not a screwdriver or device commonly available to building occupants. The window locking device must be approved by the WSU Project Manager. Deliver six special opening tools to the WSU Construction Manager at the conclusion of the project. The latching device shall be of a heavy duty commercial design standard with the manufacturer and easily operable by WSU maintenance staff.

E. Single-Source Responsibility: Provide aluminum window units from one source and produced by a single manufacturer.

1.02 OTHER REQUIREMENTS

A. Provide screens on all operating sashes in food service buildings (dining rooms, kitchens, etc.).

PART 2 - PROJECT SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

2.01 SPARE PARTS

A. Provide spare handles, gears, arms, slides, pinions, etc., for operating sashes: 5 percent of the total number for the facility.

2.02 WARRANTY

A. Manufacturer shall provide a written five-year warranty.
