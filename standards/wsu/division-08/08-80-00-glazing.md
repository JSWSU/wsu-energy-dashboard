DIVISION 08 ­ OPENINGS 08 80 00 GLAZING
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 REQUIREMENTS
A. In general, exterior windows for conditioned buildings shall be insulated glass (double glazed and sealed) with a minimum separation of one-half inch (1/2 inch).
B. Alternative materials for greenhouse applications require approval from the WSU Project Manager.
C. Where possible, windows shall be designed with provisions for cleaning, and re-glazing from the interior.
D. The use of operable windows also affects design for building HVAC, safety, and security. Operable windows must specifically be approved by the WSU Project Manager and Engineering Services.
E. When using a combination of tinted and Low "E" glass in insulating glass units, WSU strongly recommends the use of heat-strengthened or tempered glass. Regular annealed glass in these systems has a demonstrated history of poor performance at WSU.
F. Where possible, bird deterrent applications must be considered when designing large windows or curtain walls.
1.02 RESTRICTIONS
A. WSU discourages the use of metal clad wood-frame windows. These have a demonstrated history of high maintenance and relatively short service life at WSU, due to temperature and weather extremes.
B. In general, WSU discourages the use of frameless glass doors. Proposed exceptions must be approved by the WSU Project Manager.
C. In general, glazing panes shall be no larger than can be lifted and carried by two maintenance personnel (weight not to exceed 150 lbs).
