PART 2 - PRODUCTS
2.01 MANUFACTURERS

2.02 MATERIALS
A. General
1. Mortise-type locks are only acceptable as like substitutions during renovations of existing facilities. They are not acceptable in new construction.

DIVISION 08 ­ OPENINGS 08 70 00 HARDWARE AND KEYING
3. Lever type hardware shall be installed everywhere public access is required. The use of door knob hardware is prohibited.
4. Furnish silencers for door frames, except at weather stripped doors and doors with light seals, sound seals, or smoke gaskets. Furnish snap-in type silencers, 3 per single door, 4 per pair of doors.
5. Surface-mounted door bottoms are required, due to ease of maintenance and replacement. Recessed door bottoms are prohibited. Verify height and thickness. Fasten with flush screws.
6. Provide kickplates at both sides of wood doors at heavily traveled corridor areas, laboratories, equipment rooms, stairs, kitchen doors, gymnasiums, toilet rooms, classrooms and where required by ADA codes. Wood doors are of particular concern, but consider these at metal doors as well. Stainless steel is the preferred material.
7. Floor stops are not permissible. They are difficult to clean around and constitute a tripping hazard. Where a stop is desired at exterior doors in series, provide a 4 inches x 3 feet-0 inches high concrete filled metal bollard to accept the door stops (structural steel tubing may be considered for architectural purposes). These are preferable to stop arms provided as part of the closer assembly.
8. All wall-mounted hardware shall have solid backing.
9. Knox Boxes are required by the Fire Marshall. These shall be recessed into the wall adjacent to the main front entrance doors. In renovation projects where conditions prevent recessing the box, it may be through bolted to the front face of the main entrance doors. In either case, verify location and mounting elevation with the Fire Marshall.
10. Provide one coat hook on the back of each office door.
11. Provide pulls and push plates on all doors having push-pull operations. Standard push and pulls are recommended over high-maintenance custom designs.
12. Closure arms shall not extend into corridors where they can be vandalized or broken.
13. Use Phillips type flat - head screws to match hardware finish.
14. Do not use "through bolts" where the head is not exposed. Use machine screws or concealed fasteners.
15. Provide fasteners that are compatible with doors and hardware which will

MAY 20, 2016 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY

HARDWARE AND KEYING 08 70 00

DIVISION 08 ­ OPENINGS 08 70 00 HARDWARE AND KEYING
not cause corrosion of door or hardware.
16. Provide threshold with positive anchoring device. Set thresholds in a caulking compound.
17. Coordinate key requirements with WSU Key Shop for all telecommunication room locks, all mechanical room locks and roof access door locks. These locks have a WSU standard separate keying requirement which must be verified with Key Shop prior to final hardware design. These locations may require different a lock manufacturer.
B. Classroom / Lab Door Lock Requirements
1. To increase security in the event of an active threat, so that rooms can be secured from the inside, classroom and lab doors shall be equipped with the Schlage ND73 F90 Corridor lock, Schlage L9456 F13 Mortise Corridor lock (renovations only), the Schlage AD400 card swipe, or the Von Duprin -2 Double Cylinder Exit Device.
2. Standard Schlage Corridor lock specifications: i. Lock or unlock by key from outside. ii. Push-button locking from inside. iii. Turn inside lever or close door to release button. iv. When outside lever is locked by key, it can only be unlocked by key. v. Inside lever is always unlocked.
3. Schlage AD400 card swipe lock specifications: i. See electrical and installation specifications in section 28 13 00 "Access Control". ii. Push-button locking from inside. iii. Turn inside lever or close door to release button. iv. Inside lever is always unlocked.
4. Von Duprin -2 Double Cylinder Exit Device specifications:
i. Thumb turn (not keyed cylinder).
C. Electrical Items
1. Electric door strikes are preferable over electrically operated hardware. This allows for better coordination with security systems. Consult with the Project Officer and the WSU Key Shop prior to specifying.
2. Provide magnetic hold opens at area separation doors. See technical
