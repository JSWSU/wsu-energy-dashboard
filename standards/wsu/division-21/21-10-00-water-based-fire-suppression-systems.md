D. A Post Indicator Valve (PIV) shall be included in every new sprinklered building. The PIV should be located at least 20 feet from the building and shall be shown on the Contract Drawings and shall be at a minimum a 6 inch valve. All PIV locations must be reviewed and approved by the WSU Fire Marshall. All piping between the PIV and the building, including an approved back flow prevention assembly, shall be shown on the Contract Drawings.
