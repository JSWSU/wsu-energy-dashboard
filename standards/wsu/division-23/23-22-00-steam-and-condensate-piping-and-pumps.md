PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
A. Steam Distribution System: Steam is the primary heat source for a variety of functions throughout the Pullman campus of Washington State University. Saturated steam is generated at the Grimes Way and College Avenue Steam Plants and distributed via a looped piping system which operates at 100 psig (338°F). Design conditions for the steam supply are 125 psig saturated and 353°F. The distribution system serves all sections of the campus core. Discuss the expected maximum load steam volume for design conditions with the WSU Project Manager and Engineering Services.
1. The preferred method and majority of distribution steam piping is located in directly accessible tunnels allowing maintenance access, additional future utility installation, inspection, and pathway for high pressure condensate recovery. Direct bury steam and/or condensate piping or piping systems are not acceptable.
B. Condensate Return System: The condensate return system operates with up to 180°F condensate, parallel with the steam piping. All uncontaminated condensate shall be returned. If condensate will become contaminated (by process equipment, domestic water, etc.), the Design Consultant shall ensure it is cooled and discharged to the sanitary sewer. Condensate pump shall be designed to overcome existing system pressure at the connection point. Consult with WSU Engineering Services regarding existing pressures at building point of connection.
C. The WSU Pullman campus district steam system chemical treatment is operated and maintained as "Food Grade" and is suitable for direct injection humidification use.
1.02 SCOPE
A. Reference WSU Standard Detail drawings for typical installations and associated assemblies:
1. Drawing 23 22 00 M1 for typical single-stage piping schematic and miscellaneous details.
2. Drawing 23 22 00 M2 for typical two-stage pressure reducing station.

1. For renovation and renewal projects, the Process and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) shall illustrate all subcomponents of the existing systems, together with the connections and integration of all new work.
2. P&IDs shall also reference temporary steam heating during construction.
B. The scaled Construction Documents shall show the location in the existing steam tunnels from the nearest steam pipe anchors to the new connection point of the existing steam piping to be installed by the Contractor. Any and all additional required piping, pipe anchor points, piping guides and expansion joints required shall be shown in plan and elevation drawings of the connecting tunnel. Design details of the building steam and condensate piping, piping supports, externally pressurized expansion joints, spacing of the pipe guides shall be shown on contract documents. All steel embeds and support steel shall be welded steel channel or equivalent section, designed by the project structural engineer. All piping with greater than 1/8" movement (based on anticipated thermal expansion between installation and operating temperatures) shall be designed and documented in plan and elevation drawings.
C. Strut support systems are not acceptable.

In all cases, pipe size shall be 0.75" minimum size (entering and leaving), as soon as recommended conditions are met. All other valves, fittings, and accessories associated with system installations, shall be 0.75" minimum, unless otherwise approved.
D. Drip Leg Requirements: Drip legs, as a minimum, shall be same size as steam line they serve for steam line sizes 4" and below. For Steam line sizes 5" and above the drip leg shall be a minimum of 4" pipe diameter or 1/2 the diameter of the line size they serve whichever is greater. Include a blowdown valve with plug at the bottom of drip leg. Provide trap assembly, as detailed, utilizing extra heavy nipples
3.02 SAFETY VALVES:
A. Reference WSU Standard Detail drawing 23 22 00 M1.
B. Pipe vent from safety valve through drip pan elbow up through roof to a terminus 8 feet above finished roof surface. Special care shall be taken in the design so that no piping reactions are withstood by the safety valve. Vent piping exposed to weather shall be primed and painted with high heat exterior grade paint. Where safety valve vent piping is required to run horizontally, it shall be sloped down toward drip pan elbow such that there shall be no low points for water to collect.

3.03 EXPANSION PROVISIONS
A. Expansion Joints: Install with alignment and roller guides as recommended by manufacturer.
B. Anchors: Provide heavy steel collars with lugs and bolts for clamping pipe and attaching anchor braces or, at Contractor's option (or as indicated), provide weld- on type anchors. Anchors shall be installed so that attachment to structure does not injure the structure either in the installation, by weight, or due to thermal expansion forces of piping system that is being anchored.
3.04 PRESSURE GAUGES: Install with ball type isolation valve and pigtail siphon. Install as shown on drawings or as required to monitor system operation upstream and downstream of isolation and control valves.
3.05 DRAIN VALVES FOR WARM UP: Drain valves shall be provided adjacent to all sides of valves where condensate may collect, drain valves shall be located outside of insulation on schedule 80 nipples.
3.06 PRESSURE TESTING: Hydrostatically test piping, accessories, and equipment at 150% of operating pressure, 125 psig minimum, with no perceptible drop in pressure, for a period not less than 2 hours. Inform Consultant, Commissioning Agent, and WSU Construction Manager at least two days in advance, so they may witness testing. Testing with compressed air is not allowed. Provide written test description and results to WSU Construction Manager, listing personnel involved.
3.07 CLEANING: Thoroughly clean system to remove dirt, steel shavings and chips, and oil. Blow down strainers. Drain water and blow steam through system back to receiver until condensate is free of oil; run condensate to sanitary sewer drain and vent steam from receiver to outside. Open and clean entire interior of receiver before operating condensate pumps or pumping condensate back to existing WSU condensate lines. Upon completion of system cleaning, contractor shall furnish the WSU Construction Manager with written documentation of cleaning prior to pumping condensate back to campus system.
3.08 LARGE FLANGE ASSEMBLY TIGHTENING: For tightening studs on 10" and larger flanges, in campus distribution pressure piping, a written bolt tightening plan shall be submitted and reviewed by the WSU Construction Manager one month prior to scheduled work. The plan shall describe the means and methods to be utilized to determine and achieve bolt or stud tension and the means and methods used for checking bolt or stud tensions. Slug wrenches and hammers shall not be accepted.
