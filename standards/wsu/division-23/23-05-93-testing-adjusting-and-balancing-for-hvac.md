PART 2 - EXECUTION

2.01 SCOPE OF WORK

A. The Test and Balance data shall be complete and the Performance Test accepted before the project will be considered substantially complete.

2.02 BALANCING

A. Data to be read and recorded:
1. Data read and recorded shall include, but not be limited to the following:
i. Air Balance at the Fans:
1) Read all fan systems: Supply, exhaust, return, fume hoods, unit heaters, packaged units, cooling towers, etc. Set all systems so that repeatability error is less than 5% of design. Do not change design without written approval from the Prime Consultant and the WSU Project Manager.
2) Record all design fan data listed in drawings, specifications, and submittals (i.e., fan number, CFM, static pressure, O.D. sheave size, shaft diameter, RPM. expected BHP, class, manufacturer & unit size).
3) Record all design motor data (i.e., motor HP, voltage, phase, full load amperage, BHP, frame size, heater size, O.D. sheave size, shaft diameter, RPM).
4) Record all actual fan & motor data (i.e., CFM, fan RPM, BHP, Z, static pressure, motor movement, amperage, center to center of shafts, size & number of belts).
5) Record pressure drop across each coil or filter and total system pressure. Record temperatures (return, mixed, inlet & outlet).
6) Perform a velocity test for total CFM.
7) Balancing contractor shall make vibration and acoustic readings only if required by design specifications. If in the professional

judgment of the Balancing Contractor acoustic and vibration readings are required, a change proposal shall be submitted to the owner.
ii. Air Balance Branch Ducts, Boxes and Outlets:
1) Balance report to include zone, branch, mixing box number and outlet number for each grille, register or diffuser, outlet size and required velocity to reach design. All information to be provided on record drawings with updated room numbers.
2) For TEC systems, record the TEC address, the duct size and coefficient factor (rather than the mixing box number) and velocity.
3) Record design CFM for each outlet and actual CFM. Adjust dampers and repeat until design CFM has been obtained.
4) Install test ports and perform a velocity test on major branches or where required.
5) Check calibration and operation of all thermostats.
6) Check position of all manual dampers and fire dampers and the operation of all automatic dampers. Make sure "open" and "closed" positions are clearly marked on quadrant. Mark damper position at design setting.
7) Check operation and tightness of outside air dampers, leakage of more than 5% must be corrected by the Contractor. Check and set percentage of outside air required.
iii. Fume hoods: Balance according to ASHRAE 110.
iv. Water Balance at Pump, Towers or equipment on all Water Systems:
1) Record equipment name and assigned number, manufacturer's name and model number, size, impeller and the system or service. For cooling towers, record fan size and data in addition to condenser pump data.
2) Record the design and actual test data for the following: GPM, head (in ft.), discharge pressure, suction pressure, operating pressure, EWT, LWT, HP, RPM, amps, volts, BHP, & heater size. Record EAT, LAT, sheaves, belts and shaft sizes if applicable.
v. Water Balance at Box, Convector or Coil:
1) Record room number, device number (box or coil), design BTU, the design and actual GPM, pressure drop, and balancing valve size or Venturi Number.
vi. Damage, Test and Final Setting:
