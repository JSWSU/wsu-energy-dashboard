PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. These standards and procedures apply to the use and interface requirements of the Washington State University Central Chilled Water (CCW) system. Operation is year-round, and all cooling within access of this loop shall operate from it. Furthermore, no water-wasting cooling devices shall be installed in any facility.
B. The Consultant shall discuss the proposed system(s) with the WSU Project Manager and WSU Engineering Services before design begins. The Consultant shall work with WSU Engineering Services to develop a satisfactory "total system" design solution.
C. No later than 50% Design Development drawings, the Consultant shall submit a Process and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) for each major system, illustrating all subcomponents of that system, for review by the WSU Project Manager and Engineering Services.
1. For renovation and renewal projects, the Process and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) shall illustrate all subcomponents of the existing systems, together with the connections and integration of all new work.

1.03 DESCRIPTION OF THE PULLMAN CAMPUS CENTRAL CHILLED WATER LOOP SYSTEM:
A. Central Chilled Water (CCW) is the terminology used for the campus distribution system that generates and distributes campus-chilled water for HVAC cooling and process cooling loads. The system is a primary-secondary variable flow system.
1. Abbreviations: Central Chilled Water Supply (CCWS); Central Chilled Water Return (CCWR)
B. During winter months the distribution system is also used like a heat pump system to transfer waste heat for energy conservation and provide "free cooling."
C. Chilled water produced by local building systems and not physically connected to the campus distribution loop shall be termed Chilled Water (CHW), and is also addressed in this document.

1. Abbreviations: Local Chilled Water Supply (CHWS); Local Chilled Water Return (CHWR)
D. Camus Chilled Water Capacity: In addition to the main East and West Campus CCW Plants, there are six (6) chillers in existing buildings that supplement the loop and/or provide emergency backup chilled water (CHW) to critical systems within those buildings. These are a combination of air and water-cooled electric chillers totaling an additional 3,385 tons for supplemental cooling in the CCW loop, when needed. These special support chillers can be connected to cool the building only, cool the CCW loop only, or support both functions simultaneously.
1. West Campus Chilled Water Plant has one (1) 2200-ton centrifugal chiller, two (2) 1500-ton centrifugal chillers, with adjacent cooling towers located outside the facility. Each unit has its associated equipment and condenser water circulating pumps, which are constant volume. There are three distribution pumps in the plant that provide distribution from the plant into the loop system; these operate from variable speed controllers.
2. East Campus Chilled Water Plant has two (2) 1500 ton centrifugal chillers and a winter use plate heat exchanger that is capable of producing 1200 tons. There is space for a third chiller at this facility.
3. Clark Hall has two (2) 1380-ton chillers with cooling towers located on building roof. Each unit has its associated condenser water circulating pumps, which are constant volume. Each unit has its own chilled water distribution pump which is variable water volume.
4. Johnson Hall has a single 500-ton chiller.
5. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education (SCUE) has a single 400-ton chiller.
6. Biotechnology / Life Sciences Building has a single 125-ton chiller.
7. Bustad Hall has a single 100-ton chiller.
E. Storage: The CCW system includes a 2-million gallon storage tank to level the load, store next-day chilling, and avoid the capital investment required for peak chilling capability. The tank controls the CCW system operating differential pressure by allowing cold water in or supplying cold water out through the two variable speed distribution pumps. The recharge rate is limited to 5,000 GPM. Experience has proven that recharge rate for stable thermocline exists until about 5,200 GPM. Discharge rate from the tank shall be limited to 5,000 GPM with the current piping connection limitations.

1.04 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

A. Maintain differential pressure at the lowest possible pressure needed to transport the cooling water. This is due primarily to the high cost of excess pumping of this large system.

1. Design the decoupler valve to control downstream differential pressure to 10 psi.

2. Each building chilled water connection shall have a dirt separator located at the building CCW supply line. The discharge shall be controlled by solenoid valve (controlled by WSU BAS) and spill to SS floor drain.

i. Pre-Approved Manufacturer: Spirodirt

3. Provide air vents at high points and drain valves at coils for all CCW building systems.

4. Consult WSU Engineering Services for design review and assistance for design of these components.

B. Pumping shall be provided for coil or other loads using "Pumped Coil configuration." This method will be employed at all air handling units, process cooling, heat exchangers, and computer room A/C. Pumped coil components shall consist of the following:

1. Inline circulating pump which covers the pressure losses through the loop

2. Griswold flow control valve for pump protection

3. Check valve and balance valve located in the bypass.

4. Two way control valve on the return line outside the loop. Balance valves for each coil circuit will also be applied where appropriate. Control valve pressure drop is compensated by the central loop pressure and must be sized accordingly.

5. All pumped loops to include strainers downstream of the pump.

6. See standard drawing 33 60 00 M1 "Standard Chilled Water Schematic" for pump/piping configuration and components.

C. See section 25 50 00 "Integrated Automation Facility Controls" for control instrumentation and measurement and verification requirements for each system.

D. Local chillers shall not be installed in projects without specific approval from WSU Engineering Services.

E. Process Cooling:

1. Process Chilled Water (PCW) cooling, fed by the CCW, is the WSU standard for cooling equipment. Air-cooled equipment is a means of last resort only when CCW-fed process cooling is not feasible.

i. Designers must obtain approval from WSU Engineering Services before scheduling or specifying air-cooled equipment.
