Communications Distribution Section 33 82 00

PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1

SUMMARY

Review and edit the following list of generic type products and work for relevance to this project. This listing should not include procedures or processes, preparatory work, or final cleaning.

A. Provide all materials and labor for the installation of a customer-owned outside plant telecommunication system. This section includes Customer-Owned Outside Plant Communications cabling, termination, and administration equipment and installation requirements for the specified Outside Plant Structured Cabling System (OSP-SCS - See Definition Below).
Include this paragraph only if products will be furnished under this section but installed under other sections or by the Owner. When installations are "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (Owner- Installed Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Engineer/Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

B. Products installed (but not furnished) under this section: Include this paragraph only if products will be installed under this section but furnished under other sections or by the Owner. For example, WSUP may pre-purchase fiber, but have the Contractor install. When products are furnished "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (OwnerFurnished Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Engineer/Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

3.6 A.

CABLE
General (applicable to all cable types): 1. Test Mandrels: Clean each conduit with a wire brush and swab with clean rags a minimum of two
times in the same direction until the rag comes out of the conduit clean and dry. Swab away from buildings for duct sections connected to buildings. Prove out each conduit with a minimum 16 inch long test mandrel that is ¼ inch smaller than the inside diameter of the duct. 2. Install cables in compliance with ANSI/TIA/EIA requirements, BICSI practices, and manufacturers recommendations. Adhere to the requirements detailed in the manufacturer's recommendations and ANSI/TIA/EIA Standards relating to bending radius, pulling tension, other mechanical stresses, and pulling speed. a. Monitor pulling tension on runs of 300 feet or longer. Acceptable monitoring devices are:
1) Winch with a calibrated maximum tension 2) Breakaway link (swivel) 3) In-line tensiometer 3. Set up cable reels on the same sides of maintenance holes and hand holes as the conduit sections in which cables are to be placed. Level and align reels with conduit sections to prevent twisting of cables during installation into conduits. Pull cables into conduits from tops of reels in long smooth bends. Do not pull cables into conduits from bottoms of reels. Use a cable feeder guide (shoe) of suitable dimensions between the cable reel and the face of the duct to protect the cable and to guide it into the duct. Carefully inspect the cables for sheath defects as the cables are payed off the reel. If defects are found during the pulling operation or if the cable on the reel binds, twists, or does not pay off freely, stop the pulling operation immediately and notify the Owner's representative. 4. Cables of 1-¼ inch diameter or larger shall be equipped with factory installed pulling eyes, or install a core hitch on site. Use pulling grips for cables smaller than 1-¼ inches in diameter. Do not pound grips into the cable sheath to prevent the grips from slipping. Use a ball-bearing based swivel between the pulling-eyes or grips and the pulling strand. 5. Once pulling begins, and tension is applied to the cable, continue the pull at a steady rate. If it is necessary to stop the pull at any point, the tension shall not be released unless it is necessary to do so. 6. Do not splice cables unless specifically noted on the Contract Documents, or to accomplish a transition between outdoor-rated cabling and indoor rated cabling in accordance with the 50-foot rule. a. Where it is possible to terminate outdoor-rated cabling within 50 feet of exposure inside a building, directly terminate the outdoor-rated cabling without a splice transition to indoorrated cabling. b. Do not use tape with splices. c. The Contractor shall coordinate with Owner to review all splices prior to closure. 7. For new ductbank, install cables in the lowest available conduit in a duct bank, working up as additional cables are installed. For existing ductbanks, do not place cables in ducts other than those indicated on the Contract Documents. 8. Where cables are pulled through maintenance holes or handholes: a. Select the same duct at both sides of maintenance holes or handholes unless specifically noted on the Contract Documents. b. Avoid changes in duct selections, especially in elevations, to ensure that no damage occurs to the cable sheaths and that pulling tensions are kept as low as possible. c. Loop cable once around the perimeter of maintenance hole or handhole. Avoid blocking conduits with cable loop. Provide cable racking hardware to support cables inside maintenance holes and handholes. Maintain a sufficient length of cable in each

Communications Distribution Section 33 82 00

maintenance hole or handhole to properly rack the cable. Rack cables in maintenance holes and handholes as soon as practicable, but within one week after cable installation. d. After cabling has been installed, racked and labeled, photograph the interior of the maintenance hole or handhole, starting with the north wall. Provide photographs to the Owner as part of the As-built documentation. 9. Where cables are pulled through tunnels: a. Provide messenger strand through full length of route, attached to tunnel structure per manufacturer guidelines. Messenger strand shall be sized appropriately for the cable load it is intended to carry, such that its load does not exceed 25% of the strand's rating. b. Suspend cables from designated messenger strand using stainless steel lashings at intervals not exceeding 4 feet, with sag between suspension points not exceeding 1 inch. c. Provide bonding for one end of each messenger strand segment. 10. When more than one cable is being installed in a conduit, pull all cables through the conduit simultaneously. 11. Where practicable, feed cables into ducts from the end of the duct that creates the least sidewall pressure on a bend during installation (i.e. feed cable from the end closest to the bend). 12. Use pulling compound or lubricant where necessary. Use lubricants that are compatible with the cable jacket material and in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Do not use soap-based lubricants. Where cable is pulled through a maintenance hole or handhole, relubricate the cable prior to feeding into the next duct. Immediately after cables have been installed, clean lubricant from exposed cables in maintenance holes and handholes and at termination points using dry rags. 13. Seal cable ends with end caps immediately after installation and until terminated in a termination enclosure to prevent moisture entry into the core of filled cables and to prevent damage during installation. 14. Provide a service loop in the equipment room or telecommunications room long enough to reach termination equipment if moved to the farthest side of the room in the future, but no less than a minimum of 25 feet at each end. 15. Comply with the NEC 50-ft rule when installing outdoor-rated cable (i.e. do not exceed 50 feet of exposed outdoor-rated cable length within a building). 16. Cabling in the conduits: a. Where multiple conduits are used to carry cabling, fill conduits completely (per fill-ratio requirements) prior to using the next adjacent available conduit. Do not partially fill multiple conduits (and thereby waste space in a conduit) when it would be possible to completely fill that conduit. 17. Cable at the backboards: a. Lay and dress cables to allow other cables to enter raceway (conduit or otherwise) without difficulty at a later time by maintaining a working distance from these openings. b. Route cable as close as possible to the ceiling, floor, sides, or corners to insure that adequate wall or backboard space is available for current and future equipment and for cable terminations. c. Using the most direct route, secure multi pair cable to the backboard from the cable tray to the termination source. Use of D-rings in this situation is acceptable. Route via a path that will minimize obstruction to future installation of equipment, backboards or other cables. 18. Cable in the Telecommunications Rooms: a. For telecommunications rooms with ladder rack, lay cable neatly in ladder rack in even bundles and loosely secure cabling to the ladder rack at regular intervals with hook-andloop straps (similar to Velcro). 19. Building Entrances: Seal conduits (both in-use and spare) that enter the building from the outside plant to prevent intrusion of water, gases, insects and rodents. 20. Provide pull ropes as required to accomplish cable pull. At completion of cable pull, a pull rope shall remain in conduit for additional new cabling if the conduit has capacity for additional new cabling.

Test the SCS after installation for compliance to all applicable standards as follows: 1. Copper Backbone Distribution: Test copper cable on the reel upon delivery to the job site, again
prior to installation, and again after installation.

a. Test all cable pairs for length, shorts, opens, grounds, continuity, polarity reversals, termination order, transposition (wire map), attenuation, and the presence of AC voltage. All pairs shall demonstrate compliance to TIA/EIA 568-B Category 3 standards.
b. Test entire channel, from termination block to termination block. c. Use a TIA/EIA Level III testing instrument (or higher accuracy level), re-calibrated within
the manufacturer's recommended calibration period or within one year (whichever is more recent), with the most current software revision based upon the most current TIA/EIA testing guidelines, capable of storing and printing test records for each cable within the system. 1) Fluke DSP-4000 with latest software and hardware releases, or approved equal. 2. Fiber: Test fiber cable on the reel upon delivery to the job site, again prior to installation, and again after installation. a. Prior to testing, calculate the cable loss budget for each fiber optic cable and clearly show the result on the test documentation. Calculate maximum loss using the following formula, assuming no splices: 1) Backbone Distribution:
a) Max Loss = [(allowable loss/km) * (km of fiber)] + [(.3db) * (# of connectors)] b) A mated connector to connector interface is defined as a single connector for
the purposes of the above formula. c) A given fiber strand shall not exceed its calculated maximum loss (per the
above formula). b. Test all strands using a bi-directional end-to-end Optical Transmission Loss Test
Instrument (OTDR) trace performed per ANSI/TIA/EIA 455-61 or a bi-directional end-toend power meter test performed per ANSI/TIA/EIA 455-53A, and ANSI/TIA/EIA 568-B, and the Corning LANscape field testing guidelines (latest edition). Test the polarity of each pair of strands. Record the following measurements: length and attenuation. 1) Calculate loss numbers by taking the sum of the two bi-directional measurements
and dividing that sum by two. 2) Provide test measurements as follows:
a) Multimode Cable: Test at both 850 and 1300nm. b) Singlemode Cable: Test at both 1310 and 1550nm. c. Test results shall conform to: 1) The criteria specified in ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B 2) The Contractor's calculated loss budget above 3) The criteria specified in IEEE 802.3z (1000Base-X Gigabit Ethernet) a) In addition to the above, perform tests both recommended and mandated by
Corning LANscape. Tests shall confirm/guarantee compliance to Corning LANscape Ethernet 1000B-X performance, and IEEE 802.3z for a maximum end-to-end dB loss of 2.5 dB. 4) The criteria specified in IEEE 802.3z (1000Base-X Gigabit Ethernet)

C. Identify cables and equipment that do not pass to the Owner and Designer. Determine the source of the non-compliance and replace or correct the cable or the connection materials. Retest the cable or connection materials at no additional expense to the Owner. Provide a complete revised set of all test results to the Owner and Designer, in the same manner as above. Remove original individual cable test reports that are unacceptable and insert the new corrected cable test reports. Do not simply resubmit the test reports for the corrected cabling only. 1. In addition to the above, if it is determined that the cable is faulty, remove the damaged cable and replace it with a new cable. Cable repairs are not acceptable. The procedure for removing the cable shall be as follows: a. Prior to removal of damaged cable and installation of new cable: 1) Inform the Owner and Designer of the schedule for the removal and installation. 2) Test the new cable on the reel per paragraph B, above.

3) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether or not they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project.
b. Remove the damaged cable and provide new cable. c. After the removal of the damaged cable and installation of the new cable:
1) Test the new cable per the paragraph titled TESTING. 2) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the
damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project. a) If any of the cables requiring testing are in use, coordinate with the Owner to
schedule an outage opportunity during which the testing can be performed. d. If a cable which occupies the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as a damaged
cable is damaged by the extraction and installation process, replace the cable at no additional expense to the Owner. 1) Damaged cables which are replaced shall be subject to the testing procedures of the
paragraph titled TESTING.
