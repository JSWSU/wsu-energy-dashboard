Washington State University (Pullman) Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification

Communications Underground Ducts, Manholes, and Handholes
Section 33 81 26

PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1

SUMMARY

Review and edit the following list of generic type products and work for relevance to this project. This listing should not include procedures or processes, preparatory work, or final cleaning.

A. Provide all materials and labor for the installation of a pathway system for outside plant communications circuits. Work in this section includes excavation and trenching, conduit (raceway) construction, cutting and patching, concrete, maintenance hole and handhole construction, and landscaping.
Include this paragraph only if products will be furnished under this section but installed under other sections or by the Owner. WSUP frequently has the Contractor furnish patch cords, but uses their IT staff to install. When installations are "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (Owner- Installed Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

B. Products installed (but not furnished) under this section -
Include this paragraph only if products will be installed under this section but furnished under other sections or by the Owner. For example, WSUP may pre-purchase fiber, but have the Contractor install. When products are furnished "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) - Summary of Work (OwnerFurnished Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

a. MH/HH: Conduit entrances at opposite ends of a maintenance hole or handhole shall be at the same level and in the same position with respect to the side walls. Ensure that each conduit leaving a MH/HH in any position enters the next MH/HH in the same relative position.
b. Buildings: Terminate conduits 4 inches above the finished floor. 10. Length: Unless otherwise shown on the Contract Documents, do not exceed 600 feet of
ductbank between pulling points. Contact the Designer prior to proceeding if a ductbank section will exceed 600 feet. a. Record the length of each conduit on the As-Built drawings. 11. Pull Ropes & Muletape Pull Cord: Install in each conduit longer than 10 feet immediately after the conduit has been cleaned and mandreled. Leave a minimum of 10 feet looped, tied-off, and labeled at each end of the conduit. 12. Protection: Insure that after installation the conduit coatings and finishes are without damage. Repair as follows: a. PVC Coated Rigid Steel Conduit: Patch nicks and scrapes in PVC coating after installing
conduits. b. Rigid Non-metallic Conduit: Repair damage with matching touchup coating recommended
by the manufacturer.

B. Ductbanks: 1. Unless otherwise noted on the Contract Documents or required for sweep radius, construct ductbanks without concrete encasement. Where shown as concrete encased, use concrete encased RNC (see CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE, above). 2. Encased in Concrete: a. See CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE, above. 3. Conduit Spacers/Supports: Place supports on 8 foot centers if encased in concrete and 5 foot centers otherwise. Interlock spacers horizontally only. Stagger spacers encased in concrete at least 6 inches vertically. 4. Warning Tape: Install metallic warning tape half the distance between the top of the ductbank and finished grade. 5. Grounding/Bonding: Install ground wire along length of ductbank. Bond to grounding electrodes of MH/HH and to building service grounds. 6. Slope ductbank grade to fall 3 inches per 100 feet in general and ¼ inch per foot where possible. a. Slope ductbank toward lower MH/HH or from high points toward MH/HH at both ends. b. Slope ductbank away from building entrances.

LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION

A. Outside Plant Conduits: 1. Conduits shall be labeled by permanently marking the maintenance hole wall adjacent to each conduit. The markings shall indicate the maintenance hole name/number or building name where the opposite end of the conduit terminates.

B. Outside Plant Maintenance Holes: 1. Maintenance holes shall be labeled by permanently marking the wall of the maintenance hole in a location that is as high as possible while remaining visible and readable from above ground. Preferably, the location should be higher than the groundwater level in the maintenance hole. The markings shall indicate the maintenance hole name/number.

3.5

LANDSCAPING

A. Topsoil: Provide imported topsoil for excavations in grass and/or landscaped areas. Provide loosely compacted topsoil to a depth of 4 inches or depth of excavation for excavations less than 12 inches. Restore existing grades where disturbed. Rake and smooth topsoil following proper placement.
