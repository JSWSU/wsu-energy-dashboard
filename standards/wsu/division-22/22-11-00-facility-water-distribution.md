DIVISION 22 ­ DOMESTIC WATER PIPING 22 11 00 FACILITY WATER DISTRIBUTION
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Washington State University (Pullman campus) is served by both high elevation and low elevation water systems. The high elevation source is the North Fairway Reservoir. The low elevation sources are the Observatory Hill Reservoirs.
B. Refer to WSU utility record drawings for known existing conditions.
1.02 SPECIFIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Design of the WSU public drinking water system shall meet the requirements of the most current editions of Chapters 246-290 WAC and the most current edition of the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) Water System Design Manual.
B. Service mains shall be sized to meet the larger demands of either the maximum hourly domestic or the combination of maximum day domestic plus fire flow. In all cases, the minimum service main size shall be 12 inches in diameter.
C. Yearly average domestic demands shall be the product of a 60 gallon per capita day usage and projected population densities. Maximum day rates shall be taken at 150 percent of this yearly average and the maximum hourly rate shall be set at 250 percent. System losses and unaccounted for usages shall be taken at 10 percent of the domestic demand.
D. For design purposes, line velocities shall not average more than 5 feet per second. Exceeding this velocity requires approval from WSU Engineering Services.
E. Mains shall be buried 60 inches below finished grade (to the top of the pipe).
F. Gate valves eight (8) inches and larger shall be installed in a standard vault.
G. Minimum size service branch lines from main shall be 6 inches to inside curb line; reductions may be made at that location if approved by WSU Engineering Services.
H. No saddle taps allowed for service connections. Branch lines tees will be used.
I. Reclaim water pipe shall be color-coded purple.

J. Pipe bedding shall be installed per Washington State University (WSU) Standard Drawing C552.
PART 2 - PRODUCTS
2.01 GENERAL
A. Distribution main shall be one of the following (or approved equal): 1. C900 PVC "Blue Brute" 2. For sleeves, use ductile iron.
B. Fittings shall be class 350 ductile iron per the most current and adopted version of AWWA A21.53.
C. Jointing shall be mechanical. 1. Preferred manufacturer: MegaLug
D. Valves: 1. Shall be flanged, iron body, bronze mounted double disc gate; over eight (8) inches, valves to have non-rising stems. Maximum operating pressure shall be not less than 175 psi for valves up to twelve (12) inches. 2. Shall be installed vertically in level lines and shall meet most current and adopted version of AWWA C500 specifications. Flanges shall be faced and drilled, ASA Class 235, for use with full face gaskets.
E. Shells, lugs, bolts, washers, and nuts shall be type 304 stainless steel.
F. Flanges shall be type 304 stainless steel or ductile iron, most current and adopted version of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) ASTM 536-80, test rated at 200 psi, "Roman" Models SST or equal.
PART 3 - EXECUTION
3.01 GENERAL
A. Install thrust blocks in accordance with the design standards of the most current Water Agencies' Standards Design Guidelines for Water and Sewer Facilities and the manufacturer's recommendations.
B. Provide a Link-Seal assembly at the building penetration.
3.02 DISINFECTION
A. New or repaired public drinking water systems shall be disinfected prior to connection, in accordance with the standards of the most current Uniform

Plumbing Code as modified by Chapter 51-56 WAC, and in accordance with the most current version of ANSI/AWWA C651, "Disinfecting Water Mains."
B. For installation of new lines and systems, the Contractor is responsible to ensure all chlorination is performed according to the most current version of ANSI/AWWA C651, and that adequate bacteriological sampling results are obtained from a WA State approved laboratory. Submit written documentation of chlorination and bacteriological sampling to the WSU Construction Manager, for review and approval by Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) and the Water Distribution Manager, prior to placing new lines in service.
3.03 TESTING
A. Conduct pressure testing in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Contractor shall submit proposed pipe testing procedures to the WSU Construction Manager for review and approval by WSU Engineering Services.
B. No testing water or chlorinated water may be discharged into the sanitary or storm sewer system in accordance with the most current and adopted version of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-201A. All chlorinated water shall either be treated to remove chlorine prior to discharge into sewers, or discharged into an area which does not impact storm drains or surface waters. If soil is the only contaminant, the wastewater may be discharged into the storm sewer catch basins provided they are protected using Best Management Practices (BMPs), per the requirements of WSU section 33 40 00 (Storm Drainage Utilities).
C. The Contractor shall notify the WSU Construction Manager in writing at least 48 hours prior to testing. The Contractor shall make all necessary testing and sampling arrangements, making all necessary arrangements with the WA State approved testing laboratory. The Construction Manager shall notify the following as to date and time of flushing and hydrostatic and bacteriological testing:
1. Facilities Services Water Distribution Manager
2. WSU Environmental Health and Safety
3. WSU Fire Department
