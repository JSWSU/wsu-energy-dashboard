DIVISION 22 - PLUMBING 22 45 00 EMERGENCY WASHING FACILITIES

PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 SCOPE
A. Emergency Washing Facilities (EWFs) shall be readily available in the immediate work area for employees, students and visitors who may be at risk for exposure to corrosives, strong irritants, or toxic chemicals.
B. At-risk persons are considered to be exposed if there is a reasonable likelihood that the material can get on their skin or into their eyes at a concentration that would be harmful regardless of the use of PPE. An emergency shower is required when there is potential for major portions of their body to be impacted by these materials.
C. EWFs shall deliver the quality and quantity of water that is satisfactory for emergency washing purposes.
D. EWFs shall be readily available where abrading operations (e.g., sanding, grinding, sawing) may cause injury to the eye or face.
1.02 DESIGN CRITERIA
A. Location:
1. EWFs shall be available within 10 seconds and fifty (50) feet of potential exposure to corrosives, strong irritants, or toxic chemicals.
2. If strong acids or bases are used, EWFs should be installed in the immediate vicinity of chemical use (i.e. within ten feet), but outside the area where continued exposure to the hazardous material may occur or electrical hazards may be present.
3. EWFs shall be kept free of obstacles blocking their use. A door is an obstacle to EWFs. However, if the door is equipped with a "panic bar" and opens from the exposure side in the direction of the emergency washing facility, an emergency shower may be located outside the door. Protective covers such as plastic caps and shower caps are only considered obstacles if the water pressure will not easily push the cover out of the way once the unit has been activated.
4. EWFs shall be located on the same level of travel as the hazard.
5. Emergency eyewash capture bowls shall be directly plumbed to drain.
6. Providing floor drains for emergency showers is highly recommended, to capture and drain away water produced during use of the unit. If a floor

DIVISION 22 - PLUMBING 22 45 00 EMERGENCY WASHING FACILITIES
drain is provided, the piping for the drain shall have a trap primer designed to resist failure due to buildup of hard water scale. The trap primer shall be protected with an air gap.
i. It is recommended that ANSI approved eyewash units are installed adjacent to a sink and designed to discharge to the sink when activated.
ii. It is also recommended that drench hose units be installed adjacent to a sink to which they may discharge when activated. If a sink is not available to collect discharge water, it is recommended that a floor drain (equipped with a trap) be installed to capture and drain away fluid produced from use of the unit.
7. Any laboratory which has a fume hood shall be equipped with access to both an emergency shower and an eyewash unit.
8. Design shall include all consideration and requirements for barrier free installations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
9. Do not locate isolation valves for EWFs where accessible to the general public.
10. Precautions shall be taken to prevent water in the emergency washing facility from freezing.
11. All emergency washing facilities using non-potable water must have signs stating the water is "not fit for drinking" or "non-potable."
PART 2 - PRODUCTS
2.01 EQUIPMENT
A. Emergency Shower:
1. The shower head shall be an "Emergency Drench/Deluge Shower" as manufactured by Guardian, Lab Safety Supply, HAWS Company, or Encon Safety meeting the American National Standards Institute standard for Emergency Eyewash and Shower Equipment per the most current and adopted version of ANSI Z358.1.
2. A vertical, universal, highly visible emergency shower sign shall be provided for each shower; either a pictorial shower image or the words "EMERGENCY SAFETY SHOWER". For corridor locations provide a sign which visibly protrudes overhead to be identifiable in a corridor. The area around the unit must be well-lit.

3. Emergency shower shall provide at a minimum 20 gallons (75 liters) per minute (gpm) of flushing fluid for a minimum of 15 minutes at a velocity low enough to be non-injurious to the user.
4. The emergency shower must have an on-off valve that activates in one second or less and remains on without user assistance until intentionally turned off.
5. Tempered shower units shall be provided when possible. Tempered shower units shall be preset to around 80 degrees F. At a minimum, temperature of the flushing fluid shall be tepid (60 to 100 degrees F) as recommended by ANSI.
B. Emergency Eyewash:
1. The eyewash units shall be wall or pedestal mount or "Swing Away" type as manufactured by Guardian, Lab Safety supply, HAWS Company, or Encon Safety meeting the American National Standards Institute standard for Emergency Eyewash and Shower Equipment per the most current and adopted version of ANSI Z358.1.
i. Hand held sprayers (drench hose) type eyewash units shall not be used unless they are ANSI certified and meet all other placement requirements.
ii. "Pull Down" style eyewashes built into a wall in a vertical position shall not be selected for installation except to meet emergency egress aisle width requirements. Splash of water when the unit begins its downward arc discourages weekly testing by the user.
2. A vertical, universal, highly visible emergency eyewash sign shall be provided for each eyewash; either a pictorial eyewash image or the words "EMERGENCY EYEWASH".
3. Emergency eyewash shall provide at a minimum 0.4 gallons (1.5 liters) per minute (gpm) of flushing fluid for a minimum of 15 minutes at a velocity low enough to be non-injurious to the user.
4. The emergency eyewash must irrigate and flush both eyes simultaneously while the user holds their eyes open with a flushing fluid pattern no less than 4 inches and no more than 8 inches above the nozzles.
5. The emergency eyewash must have an on-off valve that activates in one second or less and remains on without user assistance until intentionally turned off. Two-valve activation devices do not meet minimum requirement.
