The detailed requirements of Plumbing Pumps (22 06 10 13), Steam and Condensate (23 22 00), Central Chilled Water (33 60 00), and Deionized Water Process Piping (40 23 13) are addressed in separate sections.
B. As part of the design process (no later than the 50% Design Development drawings), the Consultant shall submit a Process and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) for each major system, illustrating all subcomponents of that system, for review by the WSU Project Manager and Engineering Services.
1. For renovation and renewal projects, the Process and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) shall illustrate all subcomponents of the existing systems, together with the connections and integration of all new work.
1.02 GENERAL PLUMBING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Coordinate plumbing runs with Mechanical and Electrical systems to maintain grade without offsets.
B. Install each run with the minimum necessary joints and couplings, but with adequate and accessible unions for disassembly, maintenance, or replacement of valves and equipment.
C. When piping installations or modifications require roof penetrations or horizontal runs across roofs or parapets, reference the standards in section 07 70 00 "Roof Specialties and Accessories."
D. Provide drain valves at main shut-off valves, low points of piping, and apparatus.
E. All equipment, fixtures, appliances, and valves shall be installed where accessible for maintenance, removal, and replacement.
1. Install valves at each piece of equipment, fixture, or appliance so that supply and return services can be shut off to remove the item without draining the system.
2. Install valves for proper isolation of piping and equipment, including valves in branch lines to isolate sections of piping.
