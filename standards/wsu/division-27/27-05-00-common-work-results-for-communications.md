SUMMARY

This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.

The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.

Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.

Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

A. 1.2
