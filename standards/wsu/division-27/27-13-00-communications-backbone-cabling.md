a. Test copper cable on the reel upon delivery to the job site, again prior to installation, and again after installation.
b. Test entire channel, from entrance protection to patch panel. c. Use a TIA/EIA Level III testing instrument, re-calibrated within the manufacturer's
recommended calibration period, with the most current software revision based upon the most current TIA/EIA testing guidelines, capable of storing and printing test records for each cable within the system. 1) Fluke DSP-4000, or approved equal. 2. Fiber: Test fiber optic cable on the reel upon delivery to the job site prior to installation, and again after installation. a. Prior to testing, calculate the cable loss budget for each fiber optic cable and clearly show the result on the test documentation. Calculate maximum loss using the following formula, assuming no splices: 1) Horizontal Distribution:
a) Max Loss = 2.0db (per ANSI/TIA/EIA 568-B) 2) Backbone Distribution:
a) Max Loss = [(allowable loss/km) * (km of fiber)] + [(.3db) * (# of connectors)] b) A mated connector to connector interface is defined as a single connector for
the purposes of the above formula. c) A given fiber strand shall not exceed its calculated maximum loss (per the
above formula). b. Test all strands using a bi-directional end-to-end optical transmission loss test instrument
(such as an OTDR) trace performed per ANSI/TIA/EIA 455-61 or a bi-directional end-toend power meter test performed per ANSI/TIA/EIA 455-53A, and ANSI/TIA/EIA 568-B. Test the polarity of each pair of strands. Record the following measurements: length and attenuation. 1) Calculate attenuation loss numbers by taking the sum of the two bi-directional
measurements and dividing that sum by two. 2) Provide test measurements as follows:
a) Multimode Cable: Test at both 850 and 1300nm. b) Singlemode Cable: Test at both 1310 and 1550nm. c. Test results shall conform to: 1) The criteria specified in ANSI/TIA/EIA-568B. 2) The Contractor's calculated loss budget above. 3) The criteria specified in IEEE 802.3ae-2002 (10GBase-X 10 Gigabit Ethernet). a) In addition to the above, perform tests both recommended and mandated by
Corning. Tests shall confirm/guarantee compliance to Corning's performance standards and also IEEE 802.3ae-2002 for a maximum end-to-end dB loss of 2.5 dB. 4) The criteria specified in IEEE 802.3ae-2002 (10GBase-X 10 Gigabit Ethernet).

C. Identify cables and equipment that do not pass to the Owner and Designer. Determine the source of the non-compliance and replace or correct the cable or the connection materials. Retest the cable or connection materials at no additional expense to the Owner. Provide a complete revised set of all test results to the Owner and Designer, in the same manner as above. Remove original individual cable test reports that are unacceptable and insert the new corrected cable test reports. Do not simply resubmit the test reports for the corrected cabling only. 1. In addition to the above, if it is determined that the cable is faulty, remove the damaged cable and replace it with a new cable. Cable repairs are not acceptable. The procedure for removing the cable shall be as follows: a. Prior to removal of damaged cable and installation of new cable: 1) Inform the Owner and Designer of the schedule for the removal and installation. 2) Test the new cable on the reel per paragraph B, above.

3) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether or not they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project.
b. Remove the damaged cable and provide new cable. c. After the removal of the damaged cable and installation of the new cable:
1) Test the new cable per the paragraph titled TESTING. 2) Test cables that occupy the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as the
damaged cable per paragraph B, above, regardless of whether they are new cables installed as part of this project or existing cables installed prior to this project. a) If any of the cables requiring testing are in use, coordinate with the Owner to
schedule an outage opportunity during which the testing can be performed. d. If a cable which occupies the same innerduct or conduit (if not in innerduct) as a damaged
cable is damaged by the extraction and installation process, replace the cable at no additional expense to the Owner. 1) Damaged cables which are replaced shall be subject to the testing procedures of the
paragraph titled TESTING.
