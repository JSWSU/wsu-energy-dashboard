Washington State University (Pullman) Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification

Communications Equipment Room Fittings Section 27 11 00

PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1

SUMMARY

Review and edit the following list of generic type products for relevance to this project. This listing should not include procedures or processes, preparatory work, or final cleaning.

A. Provide all materials and labor for the installation of telecommunications cabinets, racks, frames, enclosures, cable management, and power hardware. This section includes hardware that supports the specified Structured Cabling System (SCS - See Definition Below).
Include this paragraph only if products will be furnished but not installed under this section (perhaps installed under other sections or by the Owner). When installations are "By Owner" consider referencing the installation to Division 1 Section 01010 (or equivalent) Summary of Work (Owner- Installed Items). If this paragraph is required for the project, the Designer must take care to clearly define any product warranty issues associated with the split responsibility.

B. Products installed (but not furnished) under this section: 1. Grounding Conductor

1.2

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Review and edit the following statement(s) for applicability to this project, restricted to describing performance, design requirements and functional tolerances of a complete system.

A. Furnish, install, test and place into satisfactory and successful operation all equipment, materials, devices, and necessary appurtenances associated with telecommunications cabinets, racks, frames, enclosures, cable management, and power hardware to support an ANSI/TIA/EIA, NECA/NEIS and lSO/IEC compliant communications Structured Cabling System (SCS) as shown on the Contract Documents.
