Communications Horizontal Cabling Section 27 15 00

PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Telecommunications Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University Pullman (WSUP) campus telecommunications projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Telecommunications projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be allinclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.1

SUMMARY

SEQUENCING

Include any requirements for coordinating work with potentially unusual or specifically required sequencing. WSUP may choose to construct a project under two bid packages one for pathways and spaces (perhaps under a General Contract), and a second bid package for the Structured Cabling System (perhaps using the WA State DIS Master Contract). The Designer must coordinate with WSUP to determine if two bid packages will be used and include verbiage in the appropriate specification sections requiring the contractors to coordinate construction phasing and schedules.

A. Provide coordination with the cabling manufacturers to ensure that manufacturers' inspectors are available to schedule site visits, inspections, and certification of the system. Provide and coordinate any manufacturer-required modifications and have manufacturer re-inspect and certify the system prior to the scheduled use of the system by the Owner.

B. The Contractor is solely responsible for all costs associated with scheduling the manufacturer inspection, the inspection itself and any manufacturer-required re-inspections, and for any modifications to the installation as required by the manufacturers.

PART 2 - PRODUCTS Ensure that products listed under the PART 2 ­ Products paragraphs have corresponding installation instructions in PART 3 ­ Execution, or in another specification section if furnished but not installed under this section.
WSUP has standardized on certain manufacturers and certain products for all new Structured Cabling Systems in WSUP facilities. Products shall be specified accordingly. The Designer shall ensure that the latest part numbers are used for specified products. Any substitutions require WSUP pre-approval before specification.
If the Designer wishes to use products that deviate from WSUP standards, a Standards Variance Request shall be made, as described in the Technology Infrastructure Design Guide (TIDG). If the alternative product is approved, the Designer shall adapt this to reflect the approved changes.
The products listed throughout Part 2 - Products below are not all-inclusive for any given project. The Designer shall ensure that all required products are specified. The Designer shall also verify that the most current part number of each specified product is listed in this section.

Lay and dress cables to allow other cables to enter raceway (conduit or otherwise) without difficulty at a later time by maintaining a working distance from these openings. b. Route cable as close as possible to the ceiling, floor, sides, or corners to insure that adequate wall or backboard space is available for current and future equipment and for cable terminations. c. Do not use D-rings to route horizontal cabling. Instead, use vertical ladder racking (securing cabling with hook-and-loop straps) and horizontal ladder racking, using the most direct route to the termination point. Route via a path that will minimize obstruction to future installation of equipment, backboards or other cables. 12. Cabling in telecommunications rooms: a. For telecommunications rooms with ladder rack, lay cable neatly in ladder rack in even bundles and loosely secure cabling to the ladder rack at regular intervals with tie-wraps or hook-and-loop straps. 13. Cabling terminating on patch panels located on racks: a. Route cables in telecommunications rooms to patch panels on racks by routing across ladder rack across top of rack and then down vertical ladder rack to patch panel. b. Wherever possible, terminate cables consecutively according to their far-end termination in intuitively occurring groups (jacks in an outlet, outlets in a room, etc.).

Provide service loops with a minimum length of 12 inches in outlet boxes and no less than 10 feet in the ER/TR's. a. For workstation outlets with both fiber and copper cabling, terminate fiber optic cabling after copper cabling has been installed and terminated.
Delete the following paragraph if there are no wet environment indoor fiber applications.
b. For fiber optic station cabling installed in wet areas, including floor boxes in slab-on-grade applications, use Indoor/Outdoor, plenum-rated, Wet Environment-rated cabling.
2. Innerduct
The Designer shall indicate in the Contract Documents where innerduct is required, consistent with the requirements described below.
a. Innerduct is required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling through all vertical riser pathways (conduits and sleeves) that exceed 4 feet in length.
b. Innerduct is also required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling through cable trays where larger outside plant cable shares the cable tray.
c. Otherwise, innerduct is not required for routing horizontal fiber optic cabling. d. Where innerduct is required, install fiber optic cable in innerduct per manufacturer's
instructions. Innerduct shall terminate within 6 inches of top of each patch panel where fiber optic cable terminates. Secure innerduct with zip-ties at intervals not exceeding 24 inches. Do not use wire or tape. e. See Sections 27 13 00 and 33 82 00 for innerduct requirements related to fiber optic backbone cabling in inside plant and outside plant backbone applications, respectively.

D. Provide hook-and-loop cable managers for managing horizontal cabling in the telecommunications rooms. Cable managers shall be black colored. 1. Cut hook-and-loop cable managers to length, such that the cable bundle is encircled with a 50% overlap. 2. Cables shall be independently supported, not attached to other existing conduit, piping or equipment. 3. Zip ties are prohibited.

3.5

LABELING AND ADMINISTRATION

A. Color Coding: Apply industry standard color coding to cable termination fields. Always apply the same color at both ends of any given cable. Cross-connections are generally made between termination fields of different colors. The color may be applied to the backboard behind the termination equipment, may be the color of a cover on the termination equipment, or may be the actual color of the insert label on the termination equipment. Use the following color code: 1. Orange: Identification of the telecommunication service (telephone company) demarcation point. 2. Green: Identification of network connections on the customer side of the demarcation point. 3. Blue: Identification of the horizontal distribution (station) cables. A blue color coding is only required at the telecommunications room end of the cable, not at the station end of the cable. 4. Brown: Identification of inter-building backbone cables. 5. Yellow: Identification of auxiliary circuits, alarms, maintenance, security, and other miscellaneous circuits. 6. Red: Identification of key telephone systems.
B. Horizontal Cables: 1. Label Colors: White. 2. At Patch Panel: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the patch panel termination point (on the rear of the patch panel). Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping

aaaaa = Room Number where outlet is located

3. At Outlet: a. Affix label at end of the cable within 4 inches of the cable end near the jack. Include a clear vinyl adhesive wrapping applied over the label in order to permanently affix the label to the cable. Using transparent tape to affix labels to cables is not acceptable. b. Affix a second label on the exterior of the faceplate, adjacent to the jack corresponding to the cable. c. Labeling shall be according to the following scheme:

aaaaa:bcdd

or

aaaaa:

bcdd

aaaaa = Telecom Room Number where patch panel is located b = Equipment Rack Number c = Patch Panel Number dd = Patch Panel Port Number

4. Apply the cable numbering shown in the horizontal cable labeling scheme found in the Appendix at the end of this specification section. For cable numbering that is not shown on the drawings, request numbering assignments from the Owner.
5. For outlets that are mounted above an accessible ceiling (such as for wireless access points), affix white adhesive label to the underside of the ceiling grid beneath the outlet such that the label is visible to a person walking through the room. The label's location shall allow a person to know which ceiling tile to remove to access the outlet.

C. Patch Panels: 1. General: Label patch panels as shown on the Contract Documents. 2. Label Colors: White. 3. Ports: Ports are typically pre-labeled by the manufacturer with sequential numbers (i.e. 1 to 48). Provide a label for each port that matches the label of the cable terminated on that port. See HORIZONTAL CABLES above. Do not cover the manufacturer's port numbering with the labels.

3.6
