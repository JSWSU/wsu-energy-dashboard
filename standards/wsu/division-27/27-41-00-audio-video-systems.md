Audio/Video Systems Section 27 41 00

PART 1 - GENERAL This section of the Audio/Visual Construction Guide Specification has references, products, procedures, processes, and work descriptions/summaries that are common to many Washington State University (Pullman) Audio/Visual projects. This information is provided in specification format to serve as a guide to the Designer in producing a CSI-compliant specification that will meet the unique requirements of WSUP Audio/Visual projects. However, this document is not intended to be a Master Specification. The information included in this section is not intended to be all-inclusive for any given project.
The Designer shall edit this section (adding and/or removing content where required) to meet the requirements of a given project.
Prior to publishing the specifications for bid or construction purposes, all edits shall be made using the MS Word Tracking Changes feature. When submitting the specifications for review at each progress milestone, print the specifications showing the revision markings.
Text in shaded boxes (such as this text) is included to aid the Designer in understanding areas of this section that may require modification for a particular circumstance. Although this text is generally written in declarative form, the Designer shall consider it guidance only. The Designer shall not assume that the content of this specification section is suitable or sufficient for any given project in its current form, and shall remain responsible for developing a thorough and complete specification that meets the requirements of the project being designed.

1.4 SUBMITTAL INFORMATION Review and edit the following list of submittals as applicable to this project. Note that the submittals listed below are specific to this section only. Division 1, Section 01300 (or equivalent) ­ Submittals should include general administrative requirements (e.g. schedule, number of copies, distribution, etc.). Either Section 01300 or this section should include a statement similar to the following, "The Contractor shall apply Contractor's stamp, sign, or initial certifying that review, verification of required Products, and coordination of information is in accordance with the requirements of the work and Contract Documents.
Any deviations from the Contract Documents or specified product data shall be clearly noted, and must be approved by the Designer prior to start of construction. The Designer shall obtain approval from WSUP prior to approving a Contractor-submitted deviation.
If the deviation is not approved by the Designer it remains the Contractor's responsibility to provide what is required in the Contract Documents".

A. Product Data Submittals: Provide submittal information for review before materials are delivered to the job site. Combine product submittals for all products and submit together as a single submittal. 1. Submit a cover letter stating that the materials will be provided as specified, and specifically listing any items that will not be provided as specified. State in the letter that the Contractor has reviewed the specified items, and agrees that they are applicable to this project in all respects. 2. Provide standard manufacturer's cut sheets and the operating and maintenance (O&M) instructions at the time of submittal review for each device in the system, regardless of whether it is submitted as specified or as an approved equal. These instructions shall detail how to install and service the equipment and shall include information necessary for rough-in and preparation of the building facilities to receive the materials. 3. For those items noted as allowing "or equal," and which are not being provided as specifically named, submit a written description detailing the reason for the substitution, along with standard manufacturer's cut sheets or other descriptive information.

Organize the PDF files on the CDROM or DVDROM in a folder structure as follows: a. Each room per building shall have a separate folder containing all documents for the equipment in that room. b. The folders shall be named in the following format: "BUILDING ­ NAME - ###" where BUILDING is the name of the building, NAME is the name (and/or number) of the room, and ### is the room number. 2. Provide to the Owner a single set of hard-copy printed documentation for each piece of audio/video equipment. Organize the documentation in a 3-ring (or similar) binder. Dispose of all other copies of the original printed documentation after verification that the electronic (PDF) version of each is stored on the CDROM or DVDROM.

PART 2 - PRODUCTS Ensure that products listed under the PART 2 ­ Products paragraphs have corresponding installation instructions in PART 3 ­ Execution, or in another specification section if furnished but not installed under this section.
WSUP has standardized on certain manufacturers and certain products for all new Structured Cabling Systems in WSUP facilities. Products shall be specified accordingly. The Designer shall ensure that the latest part numbers are used for specified products. Any substitutions require WSUP pre-approval before specification.
If the Designer wishes to use products that deviate from WSUP standards, a Standards Variance Request shall be made, as described in the Technology Infrastructure Design Guide (TIDG). If the alternative product is approved, the Designer shall adapt this to reflect the approved changes.
The products listed throughout Part 2 - Products below are not all-inclusive for any given project. The Designer shall ensure that all required products are specified. The Designer shall also verify that the most current part number of each specified product is listed in this section.
