## 3. Review Scope & Methodology

### Scope

_[Describe what was reviewed and what was excluded.]_

- **Divisions Reviewed:** _[List all CSI divisions reviewed, e.g., 02, 07, 08, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33]_
- **Drawing Sheets Reviewed:** _[List drawing sheet numbers or ranges, e.g., A1.01-A5.03, M1.01-M4.02, E1.01-E3.05]_
- **Specifications Reviewed:** _[List spec sections if applicable, or "Specifications not yet available at this phase"]_
- **Exclusions:** _[List any items explicitly excluded from this review, e.g., "Interior finishes (Division 09) deferred to CD phase review"]_

### Methodology

_[Describe how the review was conducted.]_

The review was conducted by comparing the project drawing set and available specifications against the current WSU Design Standards. Each applicable requirement was evaluated and assigned one of the following statuses:

- **Compliant [C]** — Meets WSU Design Standard requirement
- **Deviation [D]** — Differs from standard; may require variance approval
- **Omission [O]** — Required element missing from drawings/specs
- **Concern [X]** — Potential issue requiring clarification or correction

Findings were classified by severity (Critical, Major, Minor) to prioritize resolution effort. The complete checklist is attached as Appendix A.

### Standards Referenced

_[List the primary standards used, e.g.:]_

- WSU Design Standards, _[Edition/Version/Date]_
- WSU Facilities Services Supplemental Requirements, _[Date]_
- _[Any additional campus-specific standards or guidelines]_

### Variance Approval Process

_[Describe the process, e.g.:]_

Variance requests must be submitted in writing to WSU Facilities Services with the following information:
1. Specific WSU Design Standard requirement being deviated from (with section citation)
2. Proposed alternative design or product
3. Technical justification demonstrating the alternative meets the intent of the standard
4. Any cost, schedule, or operational implications
5. Written approval from the WSU Project Manager
